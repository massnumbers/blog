## About this blog

The Mass. Numbers blog uses data like election results,
poll results, candidate campaign finance reports, and
census data to evaluate Massachusetts politics and
policy.

Some of our most popular posts are about the partisan
lean of Massachusetts cities and towns, and ratings of
state legislative races based on historical outcomes.
