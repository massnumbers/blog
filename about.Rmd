## About this blog

The Mass. Numbers blog uses data like election results, poll results,
candidate campaign finance reports, and census data to evaluate
Massachusetts politics and policy.

Some of our most popular posts are about the partisan lean of
Massachusetts cities and towns, and ratings of state legislative races
based on historical outcomes. The original hosting site for the
blog was [https://massnumbers.blogspot.com]().

This new incarnation of the blog has a goal of transparency and
reproducibility by hosting the site on GitHub and including all of the
data and source code used to produce the blog's analysis. The full
source code can be accessed from a link on the menu bar or from
[https://github.com/massnumbers/blog]().
