For a guide to the redistricting principles used by the state legislatures, check out the Executive Summary of the Redistricting Red Book, published by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe primary responsibility given to redistricters by the constitution is to ensure equally-sized districts. For state legislatures, the courts have generally approved of redistricting plans where the largest and smallest districts are within 5 percent of the target population. The equal-size mandate results in the shifting of district lines as populations ebb and flow through the Commonwealth.\nThe next mandate for the redistricters comes from the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and relates to race, color, and minority language groups. While it is illegal to use race and ethnicity as factor in redistricting in the general case, it is also illegal to dilute concentrations of a minority voting block, resulting in that voting block not being able to elect its candidate of choice.\nWhile the short-hand concept of a majority-minority district is often used when evaluating redistricting plans, it is usually an oversimplification which does not addequately address minority voting block dilution. In particular, minority groups do not usually vote as a monolith. A district with 25% black voters and 30% hispanic voters is technically majority-minority, but gives neither the black voters nor the Hispanic voters the ability to elect their preferred candidate. (In practice, redistricting bodies can use techniques like ecological regression to analyze and account for historical voting patterns and tendencies.)\nThe newly drawn 2020-2021 Massachusetts State Senate districts increase the number of majority-minority districts from three to six, but only three of the districts contain a minority voting block with enough power to elect their candidate of choice. It is also clear from looking at the data that there aren’t enough geographically concentrated minority blocks in Massachusetts to do any better at this time.\nConcentrations of Minority Voting Blocks\nLet’s first look at the 2,152 voting precincts in Massachusetts by flagging any precinct that has a citizen votaing age population (CVAP) for a minority group that is over 40% of the total citizen voting age population.\nWe use citizen voting age population because that is the actual number of people who are eligible to vote, a better determinant of voting power than total population. When we look at the population numbers used to equally divide the districts, we will use total population, as required by the constitution.\n\n\nTable 1: Predominant voting group by voting precinct\n\n\nPredominant Group\n\n\nPrecinct Count\n\n\nPercent\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n1948\n\n\n91%\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n102\n\n\n5%\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n94\n\n\n4%\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n5\n\n\n0%\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n3\n\n\n0%\n\n\nIf we look at the municipality of the 204 voting precincts that have a critical mass of minority voters by municipality (103+94+5+3) it guides us towards which precincts might be grouped together into a single district to prevent dilution of that minority group’s voting power.\n\n\nTable 2: Number of plausibly minority precincts by city/town\n\n\nCity/Town\n\n\nPredominant Group\n\n\nPrecinct Count\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n71\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n29\n\n\nLawrence\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n24\n\n\nBrockton\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n18\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n12\n\n\nHolyoke\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n9\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n6\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n5\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nLowell\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n4\n\n\nLynn\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nWorcester\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n2\n\n\nNew Bedford\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n2\n\n\nCambridge\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n1\n\n\nFramingham\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nHaverhill\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nLowell\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nMethuen\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nMilton\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n1\n\n\nQuincy\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n1\n\n\nRevere\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nA statewide map of the precincts with concentrated minority representation shows the limited number and concentration of such districts.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Predominant group for all MA precincts\n\n\n\nA closer look at four of the clusters around Springfield, Lawrence, Boston, and Brockton show the biggest concentration of minority voting blocks. All but the Brockton/Randolph cluster have enough concentration to plausibly elect a minority candidate of choice.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cities with large minority voting blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistricts with Minority Power\nThe Hampden, First Essex, and Second Suffolk Districts contain a large enough percentage of a particular minority group to allow for election of a canidate of choice by that minority group.\n\n\n\nThe Hampden District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Hampden District Demographics\n\n\ntotal_pop\n\n\ncvap_total\n\n\ncvap_hispanic_pct\n\n\ncvap_black_pct\n\n\ncvap_asian_pct\n\n\ncvap_white_pct\n\n\n168,062\n\n\n117,532\n\n\n40%\n\n\n17%\n\n\n2%\n\n\n41%\n\n\nThe Hampden State Senate District contains 90 percent of Springfield’s precincts and 60 percent of Chicopee’s precincts. The district has about as many Hispanic voters as non-Hispanic white voters, giving that voting block a chance at electing their preferred candidate.\nThe current version of the Hampden district has a similar makeup and in 2020 Springfield City Councilor Alex Gomez defeated incumbent State Senator James Welch in the Democratic primary.\nA simple ecological regression model that uses Gomez’s margin over Welch as the response variable and the CVAP Hispanic percent and whether the voter is in Springfield as interacting explanatory variables ends up explaining 90 percent of the variation in the margin. Hispanic voters were much more likely to vote for Gomez, with knowing about Gomez as a Springfield voter also playing a factor.\nThe First Essex District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: First Essex District\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal_pop\n\n\ncvap_total\n\n\ncvap_hispanic_pct\n\n\ncvap_black_pct\n\n\ncvap_asian_pct\n\n\ncvap_white_pct\n\n\n167,027\n\n\n96,884\n\n\n47%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n47%\n\n\nThe First Essex State Senate District contains all of Lawrence, all of Methuen, and approximately 5 precincts of Haverhill (give or take a few census blocks). The previous lines of the district did not include Lawrence and instead included a large number of largely white surrounding communities. The new lines result in a voting age population that is 36% White, 56% Hispanic, 10% Black, and 3% Asian. The First Essex incumbent, Diana DiZoglio (D-Methuen), is running for Auditor, leaving an open race for a competitive field of candidates from Lawrence and Methuen (check out the upcoming Mass. Numbers State Sentate primary overview).\nThe Second Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Second Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal_pop\n\n\ncvap_total\n\n\ncvap_hispanic_pct\n\n\ncvap_black_pct\n\n\ncvap_asian_pct\n\n\ncvap_white_pct\n\n\n181,874\n\n\n124,934\n\n\n22%\n\n\n47%\n\n\n4%\n\n\n26%\n\n\nThe Middlesex and Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Middlesex and Suffolk District\n\n\n\nThe Middelsex and Suffolk state senate district represented by Sal DiDomenico (D-Everett) has been redrawn adding diverse sections of Cambridgeport and East Cambridge, while removing parts of Boston’s West End, Allston, and Brighton neighborhoods. The district ends up with a demographic mix of 46% White, 24% Hispanic, 12% Black, and 15% Asian. The previous incarnation of this district would have been a majority minority district with the latest demographic information, but the new lines reinforce its majority minority demographic.\nWhile DiDomenico does not have primary or general election challenger, Lydia Edwards, the incumbent of the current First Suffolk and Middlesex District which contains some of the same Cambridgeport and East Cambridge neighborhoods as the new Middlesex and Suffolk district, is running unchallenged in the new Third Suffolk State Senate District. The Third Suffolk is not majority minority, but will continue to be represented by Edwards, the only black woman in the Massachusetts State Senate, and one of only three people of color in the state senate.\nThe Second Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Second Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\nThe Second Plymouth and Norfolk District was a late-comer to the majority minority district additions during the latest redistricting process. The first draft of the senate redistricting plan left the Brockton-based district almost unchanged and grouped with the mostly white surrounding suburb of Hanover, Plympton and Easton. Pressure from redistricting advocacy groups led to a plan which extended the district through Avon into parts of Randolph that moved the demographics of the district into majority minority, while moving the white suburbs into adjacent districts.\nThe newly configured district has attracted an experienced Democratic challenger in Randolph Town Councilor Katrina Huff-Larmond who could increase the number of black women in the senate above one, Lydia Edward (D-Boston), if she were to win the primary on September 16th.\nThe remaining majority minority districts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This post spends some time looking at redistricting, specifically the new majority minority state senate districts, and then at each of the contested state senate primaries.\nNew majority minority districts\nThe Massachusetts State Senate lines have been redrawn by the legislature after the 2020 Census as required by the constitution. Redistricting established two new majority minority districts.\nThe First Essex State Senate District—one of the new majority districts—contains all of Lawrence, all of Methuen, and approximately 5 precincts of Haverhill (give or take a few census blocks). The previous lines of the district (the dotted line in the map below) did not include Lawrence and instead included a large number of largely white communities. The new lines result in a voting age population that is 36% White, 56% Hispanic, 10% Black, and 3% Asian. The First Essex incumbent, Diana DiZoglio (D-Methuen), is running for Auditor, leaving an open race for a competitive field of candidates from Lawrence and Methuen (see the First Essex primary overview below).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: First Essex State Senate District\n\n\n\nThe other newly created majority minority is the Middlesex and Suffolk District with incumbent Sal DiDomenico (D-Everett). Redistricting has added diverse sections of Cambridgeport and East Cambridge, while removing parts of Boston’s West End, Allston, and Brighton neighborhoods. The district ends up with a demographic mix of 46% White, 24% Hispanic, 12% Black, and 15% Asian. DiDomenico does not have primary or general election challenger.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Middlesex and Suffolk State Senate District\n\n\n\nThe other majority minority State Senate districts are the Springfield-based Hampden district of Adam Gomez (D-Springfield), the Boston-based Second Suffolk district of Sonia Change-Diaz (D-Boston) who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor, and the Second Plymouth and Norfolk district with incumbent Senator Michael Brady (D-Brockton).\nThe full State Senate map is given here with dashed lines for previous State Senate district lines and some demographics (partisan lean, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: MA State Senate Districts (2022)\n\n\n\nState Senate Primary Overview\nThere are ten State Senate districts with contested primaries. There are three Democratic incumbents with primary challengers—Joan Lovely (D-Salem), Walter Timility (D-Milton), Michael Brady (D-Brockton)—and one Republican with a primary challenge, Patrick O’Connor (R-Weymouth).\nThere are five open seats with four having just a Democratic primary, and one seat—Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester—with both a Democratic and Republican primary.\n\n\nTable 1: 2022 State Senate districts, post-redistricting\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\nPVI\n\n\ninc_status\n\n\nIncumbent\n\n\nprimaries\n\n\nBerkshire, Hampden, Franklin and Hampshire\n\n\nD+18\n\n\nNo_Incumbent\n\n\n(Adam Hinds—Pittsfield)\n\n\nD\n\n\nHampden and Hampshire\n\n\nD+6\n\n\nDem_Incumbent\n\n\nJohn C.

The incumbent of the existing and similarly named Berkshire, Hampshire, Franklin and Hampden district, Adam Hinds (D-Pittsfield) ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor, leaving this district without an incumbent senator.\nThe Democratic primary will feature sitting State Representative Paul Mark (D-Becket) whose current Second Berkshire State Representative district is outlined in the map, and Williamstown small business manager and activist Huff Templeton III. Representative Mark will have a considerable advantage as almost a quarter of the Senate district’s Democratic primary voters will have seen him on the ballot, and likely will have voted for him in the past.\nThe D+18 Partisan Voter Index (PVI) will make the winner of the Democratic primary the prohibitive favorite in November’s general election against unenrolled candidate Brendan Phair of Pittsfield.\nHampden, Hampshire and Worcester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Hampden, Hampshire and Worcesterm\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nHampden, Hampshire and Worcester\n\n\n17987\n\n\nN\n\n\nSydney R.

The dashed line on map shows the overlap of the Oliveira-held Seventh Hampden State Rep district.\nOliveira comes off a hotly contested State Rep win where he defeated Republican James “Chip” Harrington by 134 votes after a recount. Perennial candidate Harrington is running for state rep again against Democrat Aaron Saunders of Belchertown.\nLevin-Epstein served as Deputy Finance Director for Ed Markey’s 2020 re-election campaign and is bringing her political organizing experience to bear on her own campaign this year.\nThe two GOP candidates are John Harding of East Longmeadow, a former military office who says he has been called by God to run, and William Johnson, a business owner from Granby.\nFirst Worcester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Hampden, Hampshire and Worcesterm\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nFirst Worcester\n\n\n17986\n\n\nN\n\n\nRobyn K.

Governor Tim Murray.\nJoseph Petty is the former mayor of Worcester and has gained the endorsement of Senator Ed Markey.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face undeclared candidate Liz Mair of Berlin former online communications director for the Republican National Committee.

Anketell\n\n\nR\n\n\nPeabody\n\n\nAssistant Majority Leader Joan Lovely (D-Salem) faces a primary challenge from Kyle Davis of Danvers. Davis has pursued a career as an artist and performer, supporting himself with day jobs as a waiter and food delivery driver, and is running in a attempt to diversify the legislature with people from atypical political backgrounds.\nThe winner for the Democratic primary will face Republican Damian Anketell who seems to have previously run for Essex County Sheriff as a Democrat. Anketell has been featured at Mass. GOP events promoted by Howie Carr to get a referendum question on the ballot to deny drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants.\nThe D+12 district will likely go to the Democrat, regardless of primary outcome, but the incumbency advantage of Lovely would make it highly unlikely for a GOP pickup.\nSecond Suffolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Second Suffolk State Senate Districtm\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nSecond Suffolk\n\n\n18013\n\n\nN\n\n\nMiniard Culpepper\n\n\nD\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nSecond Suffolk\n\n\n16694\n\n\nN\n\n\nNika Elugardo\n\n\nD\n\n\nJamaica Plain\n\n\nSecond Suffolk\n\n\n18047\n\n\nN\n\n\nJames E.

There are five candidates vying for the Democratic nomination and the primary winner will take office in January, given that no non-Democratic candidates qualified for the race, not to mention its status as the most Democratic Massachusetts state senate district with a whopping PVI of D+42.\nThere are two sitting State Representatives in the race for the Second Suffolk. Nika Elguardo (D-Jamaica Plain) represents the 15th Suffolk State Representative District (dotted outline in the map), and Liz Miranda (D-Boston) represents the 5th Suffolk State Representative District (dashed outline in the map). Neither of these state representative districts overlaps with Second Suffolk State Senate district to a large extent.\nMiniard Culpepper is a Baptist minister, lawyer, and community activist. James Grant is a former law enforcement officer and teacher.\nDiane Wilkerson is a former State Senator who was convicted went to prison for accepting bribes related to granting of liquor licenses. She is out of prison and again running for public office.\nFirst Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: First Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nFirst Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n18085\n\n\nN\n\n\nRobert William Stephens, Jr\n\n\nD\n\n\nHanson\n\n\nFirst Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n16317\n\n\nY\n\n\nPatrick Michael O’Connor\n\n\nR\n\n\nWeymouth\n\n\nFirst Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n18101\n\n\nN\n\n\nRonald J. Patuto\n\n\nR\n\n\nMarshfield\n\n\nSenator Patrick O’Connor (D-Weymouth) is the only incumbent GOP senator to face electoral opposition in 2022. O’Connor is widely considered a moderate Republican in the Massachusetts vein. He did vote against the final version of the MA ROE Act, citing issues of expanding third trimester abortions and removal of most parental consent.\nSenator O’Connor faces Marshfield Republican Ronald Patuto in the GOP primary. There isn’t a great deal of information around Patuto’s candidacy, but his Facebook timeline features promotions anti-masking and anti-vax rallies.\nWhile I am not publishing model-based predictions for the primaries, this race is one where the general election model shows a big difference between the probability of a GOP general election win if O’Connor, the incumbent wins the primary (93% likelihood of GOP win), and if Patuto, the challenger wins the primary (21% likelihood of GOP win). This contrast demonstrates the power of incumbency and the fact that this moderate-for-MA state senate district (it is the 13th most Republican-leaning State Senate District) has as a Partisan Voter Index (PVI) of D+9, making it an easy-enough Democratic target without an incumbent Republican on the ballot.\nNorfolk, Plymouth and Bristol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Norfolk, Plymouth and Bristol District\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nNorfolk, Plymouth and Bristol\n\n\n13294\n\n\nY\n\n\nWalter F.

Muello\n\n\nR\n\n\nBraintree\n\n\nState Senator Walter Timilty (D-Milton) is considered on the conservative side of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. One recent example would be his “No” vote on the MA ROE Act to expand and codify the right to an abortion in Massachusetts.\nTimilty’s challenger for the Democratic nomination is Kathleen Crogan-Camara who is running on a platform promoting disability rights, but is also challenging Timilty with a much more progressive view on issues like women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigrant rights.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face another perennial candidate, Republican Brian Muello of Braintree who has run unsuccessfully for Mayor of Braintree, Braintree selectman, Braintree Town Clerk, and U.S. Senate.\nSecond Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Second Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nSecond Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n14822\n\n\nY\n\n\nMichael D.

As mentioned in the redistricting section, the Second Plymouth and Norfolk district is also newly minted majority minority district with 49% White, 35% Black, 8% Hispanic, and 3% Asian in terms of voting age population.\nSenator Brady has weathered some challenges over the past several years, having been arrested for drunk driving in 2018 and being stripped of his committee chairmanship. Brady has since been re-instated to his leadership positions, presumably after serving out his probation with a dismissal of charges as per agreement.\nChallenger Katrina Huff-Larmond, a Randolph Town Councilor, is campaigning on change, leadership, a deeper connection with the people. In addition, Huff-Larmond participated in the redistricting process and by running, is providing this newly majority minority district the choice of a candidate of color.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Jim Gordon of Hanson who is running on a platform for parental review of educational material, restoring qualified immunity for law enforcement, and cutting taxes while increasing infrastructure spending. The simple, but fallible model I use for estimating general election results based on PVI, incumbency, and whether it is a presidential voting year gives Gordon a 2 out of 100 chance of winning against Brady and a 1 out of 10 chance at beating Huff-Larmond.\nCape and Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Second Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nCape and Islands\n\n\n16300\n\n\nY\n\n\nJulian Andre Cyr\n\n\nD\n\n\nTruro\n\n\nCape and Islands\n\n\n18056\n\n\nN\n\n\nDaralyn Andrea Heywood\n\n\nR\n\n\nWest Barnstable\n\n\nCape and Islands\n\n\n18053\n\n\nN\n\n\nChristopher Robert Lauzon\n\n\nR\n\n\nMills Village\n\n\nState Senator Julian Cyr is free from Democratic primary challengers in 2022, but will face the winner of a two-way Republican primary in November. It is quite unlikely that the Republican nominee will unseat incumbent Cyr in the D+12 Cape and Islands District.\n\n\n\n",

Numbers blog began in November of 2012 with a post comparing Elizabeth Warren’s win over Scott Brown to Martha Coakley’s 2010 loss, observing that Warren’s largest gains came in working class cities like Holyoke, Lawrence, Chelsea, and Brockton.\nSome of the things that enabled posts like these were easily accessible fine-grained election results and a nice tool for creating interactive maps: Google Fusion Tables. As you might have seen by clicking on the first post, Google stopped supporting Google Fusion Tables in 2019.\nThis new version of the Mass. Numbers blog is enabled by some other new tools. The technologies of Rmarkdown, Distill, and GitHub Pages allow for creating data-driven blog posts that can be compiled into nice looking web pages, but also allow for including all of the data and analysis that appear in the post. This is exciting because it reduces the number of steps between analysis and publishing a result, but also because it promotes transparency, open data journalism, and reproducible data science.\nIf you read a post on this blog and are curious about how the analysis was done, you can look at the linked GitHub repository and see the .Rmd source of the post and the referenced data, checked in and versioned in the repository.\nOne other shout-out goes to the tmap mapping library that does Google Fusion Tables one better by making it easy to create data driven maps, both static maps and interactive maps, with a simple configuration option. The fact that I can create the maps completely with code allows for a great deal of automation, reducing the amount of manual work to create a map, and resulting in something that is documented and reproducible.\nI am guessing that most readers of this blog are interested in the political analysis and data visualizations, but I felt that it made sense to explain the evolution of the technology behind this writing and to help others who are interested in reproducing the results, or want to take the analysis in another direction.\nI am interested in your feedback. You can send me feedback through my @bwbensonjr twitter, or using the email address with username brent and the domain of this website.\n\n\n\n",
