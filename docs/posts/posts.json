    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressman Seth Moulton (D-Salem) has\nannounced\nthat he will challenge Senator Ed Markey (D-Malden) in the 2026\nDemocratic primary for the United States Senate. Several potential\ncandidates have already\nannounced\ntheir intention to run for the 6th Congressional seat, but many more\nare likely to get in the race given how rarely congressional seats are\nopen.\nThis post will look at the 39 municipalities, 22 State Representative,\n7 State Senate, and 3 Governor’s Council districts that overlap the\n6th Congressional district to consider a range of elected officials\nwho might consider a run for the seat. While the law does not require\nthat a Congressional candidate live in the district they are running\nto represent, it is very rare for a candidate to break that norm. I\nwill focus on elected officials who live in the 6th district.\nDistrict Overview\n\nThe Massachusetts 6th Congressional District is “the North Shore\ndistrict,” encompassing 31 of the 34 cities and towns of Essex County\nand an additional eight Middlesex County towns. The only\nmunicipalities that are not fully contained in the 6th District are\nthe Middlesex towns of Bedford and Billerica with 4 out of 5 Bedford\nprecincts and 5 out of 12 Billerica precincts sitting inside the 6th\nCongressional District.\nThere are three notable northern Essex County cities that are not in\nthe 6th Congressional District—Haverhill, Lawrence, and\nMethuen—which are all part of Lori Trahan’s 3rd Congressional\nDistrict.\nCities and Towns\nThere are 32 towns and 7 cities in the 6th District. Of the seven\ncities, the largest by far is Lynn with a population of just over\n100,000. The mayors of those cities—worth looking into as\npossible congressional seat contendors—are listed below.\n\n\n\n      \n      \n      County\n      \n        District Population\n      \n      Mayor\n    \n      \n    Amesbury\n\nCity\nEssex\n17,279\n\nKassandra GoveAndover\n\nTown\nEssex\n36,491\n\nBeverly\n\nCity\nEssex\n41,293\n\nMichael P.

Lawrence Quintal, the Republican candidate from\nTaunton, has said that he will request a recount which is not\nautomatic, but requires a small number of signatures. Once the\nsignatures have been certified, the state takes on the funding and\norganization of the recount. It is rare for a recount to change the\nresult.\nThe special election took place because of the passing of\nRepresentative Carol Doherty (D-Taunton) who died in February from\npancreatic cancer. Lisa Field is a lobbyist for the Massachusetts\nNurses Association and Lawrence Quintal is the co-owner of Silva\nFuneral Home and a Taunton City Councilor.\n\n\nThird Bristol special election votes by precinct/city/town\n    \n      Lisa Field (D)\n      Lawrence Quintal (R)\n      Margin\n    Easton\n    Easton 4A\n203\n216\n-13Easton 5\n409\n302\n107Easton 6\n421\n443\n-22Total\n1,033\n961\n72Taunton\n    Taunton 1-A\n137\n111\n26Taunton 1-B\n192\n259\n-67Taunton 2-A\n50\n56\n-6Taunton 2-B\n100\n93\n7Taunton 5-A\n86\n96\n-10Taunton 5-B\n158\n86\n72Taunton 7-A\n197\n215\n-18Taunton 7-B\n178\n258\n-80Taunton 8-A\n238\n209\n29Taunton 8-B\n206\n214\n-8Total\n1,542\n1,597\n−55Grand Total\n2,575\n2,558\n17\n\nLisa Field won the Easton precincts by 72 votes, while Taunton’s\nprecincts created a 55 vote margin for Lawrence Quintal.

Fields margin of 0 points is about 3 points\nless than Harris’s margin in November, 2024.\nBased on the candidate fundraising reports to the Office of Campaign\nand Political Finance,\nboth candidates raised over $50,000 and were able to put their case in\nfront of prospective voters, resulting in a close election in a\ndistrict that was represented by Republican Mayer Shaunna O’Connell\n(R-Taunton) for almost ten years from 2011 until 2020 before\nRep. Doherty’s win in a 2020 special\nelection.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts remained reliably blue in the 2024\npresidential election with Kamala Harris taking 61% of the\nvote. However, Massachusetts has seen increase in Donald Trump’s vote\nshare going from approximately 32% of the vote in 2016 and 2020\nto 36% in 2024.\nThe statewide shift has not been uniform with some areas moving\ntowards Trump while other areas became even more Democratic. To better\nunderstand these shift we use statistical analysis of demographic\nfactors to better understand which factors are associated with the\nshifts.\nWe will use Massachusetts State Representative districts as the unit\nto measure the vote shift and demographic factors. The advantage of\nusing State Rep. districts is that they are approximately the same\nsize in terms of population (currently about 44,000 people), and they\nare created with the guidance of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) with the\ngoal of not breaking up voting blocks along the lines of race and\nminority language groups, resulting in variations that provide good\ncontrasts for our statistical analysis. (There are more details on\nredistricting and district formation in the Mass. Numbers deep-dive\non State Senate\nredistricting.)\nDistricts with the largest shifts\nIt is important to emphasize that we are examining voting behavior\nshifts rather than district partisanship. All of the districts with\nthe largest shifts towards Trump are majority Democratic\ndistricts. The district with the largest shift towards Trump, the\nTenth Hampden District in Springfield, remains remarkably Democratic\nwith a Partisan Voter Index (PVI, an average of the last two\npresidential elections compared to the U.S. as a whole) of D+24, even\nafter an eight point Republican shift.\nThe districts with the largest shifts towards Trump are:\n\n\nDistrict\n      Cities/Towns\n      PVI\n      Representative\n      Shift\n    Tenth Hampden\nSpringfield\nD+24\nCarlos Gonzalez (D-Springfield)\nR+8Fourth Essex\nLawrence, Methuen\nD+12\nEstela A.

Vieira (R-Falmouth)\nIncumbentKathleen Fox Alfano (D-Bourne)\nState Representative - Ninth NorfolkPVI: D+6, Model: R+2\n    Marcus S. Vaughn (R-Wrentham)\nIncumbentKevin C.

Ferrante (U-Holden)\nState Representative - Twenty-Second MiddlesexPVI: D+1, Model: R+9\n    Marc T. Lombardo (R-Billerica)\nIncumbentGeorge John Simolaris, Jr. (U-Billerica)\nState Representative - Fifth BarnstablePVI: D+1, Model: R+10\n    Steven G. Xiarhos (R-Barnstable)\nIncumbentOwen G. Fletcher (D-Barnstable)\n\n\nThe Ninth Norfolk district features a rematch between now-incumbent\nMarcus Vaughn (D-Wrentham) and Kevin Kalkut (D-Norfolk) who faced each\nother in 2022 when Shawn Dooley (R-Norfolk) ran against Becca Rausch\n(D-Needham) for the Norfolk, Middlesex and Worcester State Senate\nSeat. The model gives Vaughn extra points as an incumbent, but the\npresidential year advantage for Democrats keeps the model’s average\nsimulated outcome to an R+2 margin.\n\n\n\nThe next set of competitive races are open seats which lean slightly\nRepublican with PVIs R+1 or R+2.\n\n\nState Representative - Eighth BristolPVI: R+2, Model: D+5\n    Steven J. Ouellette (D-Westport)\nChristopher Thrasher (R-Westport)\nJesse W. St. Gelais (U-Acushnet)\nLaura A. Hadley (U-Westport)\nManuel Soares, Jr. (U-Westport)\nState Representative - Eighth PlymouthPVI: R+1, Model: D+5\n    Dennis C. Gallagher (D-Bridgewater)\nSandra M. Wright (R-Bridgewater)\nState Senate - Third Bristol and PlymouthPVI: R+1, Model: D+7\n    Joseph Richard Pacheco (D-Raynham)\nKelly A. Dooner (R-Taunton)\nJames B. Dupont (U-Raynham)\n\n\nThe majority of the model training comes from head-to-head\nDemocratic/Republican matchups, so we should treat the four districts\nthat are not D/R head-to-heads as being even more unpredictable than\nthe +/- 20 or so points that the model has for its 95% confidence\ninterval.\nThe First Worcester and Twenty-Second Middlesex State Representative matchups both have a Republican incumbent facing an Unenrolled candidate, rather than a Democrat.\nThe Eighth Bristol State Representative race has Democrat Steven Ouellette, Republican Christopher Thrasher, and three Unenrolled candidates in the five candidate mix.\nThe only State Senate race on our list, the Third Bristol and Plymouth, features Democrat Joseph Pacheco (no relation to the retiring Senator Marc Pacheco), Republican Kelly Dooner, and independent James Dupont.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nResignations by Massachusetts State Representatives Jon Santiago and\nEd Coppinger have resulted in Special State Primary elections on May\n2, 2023 to elect their successors in the South End-based 9th Suffolk\nand West Roxbury-dominated 10th Suffolk districts. There are five\nDemocratic candidates who submitted signatures and qualified for the\ntwo primary ballots.\nAmparo “Chary” Ortiz has withdrawn from the 9th Suffolk race leaving\nJohn Moran as the presumptive winner of the South Boston-based\nseat. There are three strong candidates for 10th Suffolk seat\nDemocratic primary, each one bringing different different assets to\nthe race, including their three distinct neighborhoods.\n\n\nTable 1: 10th Suffolk State Rep Candidates\n  \n  Candidate\n      \n      Neighborhood\n    Bill MacGregor\nLoan Officer\nWest RoxburyRobert Orthman\nAttorney\n RoslindaleCelia Segel\nHealth Policy Director\nJamaica Plain\n\nBoston Neighborhoods and their State Rep Districts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 160 State Representatives in the Massachusetts House of\nRepresentatives with 19 Suffolk County-based representatives, each who\nrepresents about 44,000 citizens from Boston or adjacent\ncommunities. Only two of the State Rep districts—East Boston’s\n1st Suffolk and Dorchester’s 13th Suffolk—are contained in a\nsingle Boston neighborhood. Every other Suffolk-based State Rep\ndistrict crosses neighborhood boundaries.\nHow important are the neighborhood boundaries to Boston state\nlegislative races? The 10th Suffolk race is an extreme example where\nall three candidates are from different neighborhoods and one\nparticular neighborhood, West Roxbury, contains over half of the\nlikely voters.\n10th Suffolk Neighborhoods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will use the votes from the 2022 State Democratic Primary to\nestimate the percentage of votes that we might see from each\nneighborhood in the May 2nd special primary.\nThe 10th Suffolk State Representative district has 22 Boston precincts\nand a single precinct in Brookline. Two of the Boston precincts are\nsplit between Roslindale and West Roxbury, complicating the estimated\nvote breakdown, but we can use the relative size of the neighborhood\nparts and adjust the vote totals accordingly (94% to 6%). Boston Ward 20 Precinct\n1 is mostly in Roslindale with a small dip into West Roxbury, while\nWard 20 Precinct 7 is more evenly split with 57% of the votes coming\nfrom Roslindale and 43% coming from West Roxbury.\n\n\nTable 2: 10th Suffolk Precincts\n  \n  Precinct\n      Neighborhood\n      2022 Dem.

Primary Votes\n      % of Votes\n    Brookline\n538\n5%Jamaica Plain\n1,364\n13%Roslindale\n2,493\n25%West Roxbury\n5,776\n57%\n\nNeighborhood Advantage\nThe obvious neighborhood advantage would seem to go to Bill MacGregor\nwith his home base of Roxbury and his endorsement by departing State\nRepresentative and West Roxbury stalwart Ed Coppinger.\nThe story for Robert Orthman is more complicated as he is originally\nfrom West Roxbury while currently making his home in\nRoslindale. Orthman has also received the mainstream endorsement of\nthe Boston Globe, while also being endorsed by some progressive and\nactivist groups.\nCelia Segel is at a relative disadvantage with only 13% of the votes\nlikely to come from Jamaica Plain, but gotten high profile\nendorsements from Emily’s List, the MTA, and sitting legislators like\nCindy Creem, Becca Rausch, and Julian Cyr.\nIt is very hard to understand the dynamics and predict an outcome in a\nthree-way race without high-quality polling, which presumably the\ncandidates or associated groups have done. As is often said, the poll\nthat really matters is the one at the ballot box on Tuesday. In the\nmeantime, we can speculate on how much the influence the home\nneighborhood of each candidate will play in the final outcome for the\n10th Suffolk legislative seat.\n\n\n\n",

There have been several\nnoticeable geographic trends in Massachusetts partisanship over the\nlast 50 years including increased Democratic dominance in far Western\nMassachusetts, a move from Republican to Democratic support in the\nrich suburbs of Boston, and stubborn Republican consistency in the\nrural parts of Hampden County and much of Worcester, Bristol, and\nPlymouth counties.\nIn 1984 82% of Massachusetts’ cities and towns voted for Republican\nRonald Reagan over Walter Mondale and Reagan carried a small majority\nof the Commonweath’s voters. In 1996, Bill Clinton won a majority of\nvotes in all but nine Massachusetts municipalities while besting Bob\nDole by over 25 points.\nThis retrospective looks at the two-party (Dem/GOP) vote margin for\nevery Massachusetts presidential election from 1972 through 2020 and\nidentifies municipalities that have been consistently Democratic,\nconsistently Republican, and towns that have seen political\ntransformation over the last 50 years. (The Democratic Margin is the\nnumber of percentage point difference between the Democratic candidate\nand the Republican candidate. For example, in Carlisle, MA in 1972\nGeorge McGovern (D) got 571 votes (39%) while Richard Nixon (R) got\n896 votes (61%) giving a Democratic margin of 39% - 61% = -22 points.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1972\n\n\n\nGeorge McGovern (D) 55% over Richard Nixon (R) 45%\n1976\n\n\n\nJimmy Carter (D) 58% over Gerald Ford (R) 42%\n1980\n\n\n\nRonald Reagan (R) 50% over Jimmy Carter (D) 50%\n1984\n\n\n\nRonald Reagan (R) 51% over Walter Mondale (D) 49%\n1988\n\n\n\nMichael Dukakis (D) 54% over George HW Bush (R) 46%\n1992\n\n\n\nBill Clinton (D) 62% over George HW Bush (R) 38%\n1996\n\n\n\nBill Clinton (D) 69% over Bob Dole (R) 31%\n2000\n\n\n\nAl Gore (D) 65% over George W Bush (R) 35%\n2004\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry (D) 63% over George W Bush (R) 37%\n2008\n\n\n\nBarack Obama (D) 63% over John McCain (R) 37%\n2012\n\n\n\nBarack Obama (D) 62% over Mitt Romney (R) 38%\n2016\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton (D) 65% over Donald Trump (R) 35%\n2020\n\n\n\nJoe Biden (D) 67% over Donald Trump (R) 33%\n\n\nConsistently Republican towns\n\n\n\nThe only Massachusetts municipality that has voted Republican in every\npresidential election from 1972 through 2020 is Granville, a small\ntown in Hampden County on the Connecticut border. It’s western\nneighbor, Tolland, came close to sharing this distinction, but was\nprevented by a 75 to 75 vote tie between President Bill Clinton and\nchallenger Senator Bob Dole in 1996.\n\n\nHistorically Republican towns (Dem margin 1972-2020)\n    city_town\n      1972\n      1976\n      1980\n      1984\n      1988\n      1992\n      1996\n      2000\n      2004\n      2008\n      2012\n      2016\n      2020\n    Blandford\n−52\n−29\n−49\n−43\n−22\n−5\n10\n−11\n−3\n−1\n−7\n−23\n−19Granville1\n−57\n−29\n−53\n−56\n−39\n−23\n−9\n−21\n−9\n−10\n−14\n−24\n−17Montgomery\n−42\n−24\n−28\n−48\n−30\n−17\n2\n−19\n−8\n−4\n−11\n−17\n−12Tolland\n−26\n−16\n−33\n−45\n−32\n−8\n2 0\n−10\n−8\n−4\n−17\n−31\n−161 Granville is the only city/town to vote Republican in every election\n    2 Tolland's only non-GOP victory was a 75-75 vote Clinton-Dole tie in 1996\n    \n\nAll four of these solidly Republican towns are in the western\nMassachusetts county of Hampden. The Democratic-leaning Pioneer Valley\ncities like Springfield, Chicopee, and Holyoke keep Hampden County\nfrom being the most Republican county in the state.\nThe bluest of the blue\nThe most Democratic municipalities in Massachusetts include the\nuniversity-dominated cities of Amherst and Cambridge, and two towns on\nthe ocean, Provincetown on the tip of Cape Cod and Aquinnah on the\nwestern end of the island of Martha’s Vineyard.\n\n\nHistorically Democratic cities/towns (Dem margin 1972-2020)\n    city_town\n      1972\n      1976\n      1980\n      1984\n      1988\n      1992\n      1996\n      2000\n      2004\n      2008\n      2012\n      2016\n      2020\n    Amherst\n37\n36\n43\n42\n51\n68\n67\n63\n74\n79\n74\n82\n85Aquinnah1\n33\n71\n57\n79\n74\n74\n84\n80\n85\n83\n74\n74\n80Cambridge\n49\n47\n51\n53\n57\n68\n72\n70\n74\n79\n78\n87\n87Provincetown2\n33\n43\n28\n35\n55\n73\n78\n75\n77\n78\n82\n82\n861 Aquinnah had the largest average Democratic margin of 73 points\n    2 Provincetown had the largest median Democratic margin of 74.5 points\n    \n\nCommunities with colleges and universities are often more liberal than\nsurrounding communities (but is is not\nclear\nwhether this is a causal relationship).\nThe resort town of Provincetown has had a long association and support\nfor the LGBTQ+ community and progressive politics in general. The\nisland town of Aquinnah is an import ancestral area for the indigenous\nWampanoag people and continues to have a significant indigigenous\npopulation, which may explain some of its Democratic\nstrength.\nHistoric Margins by City/Town\nSorted by 2020 Democratic vote margin\n\n\nMA Dem-GOP Presidential margin 1972-2020\n    city_town\n      1972\n      1976\n      1980\n

counties, and also the ring of affluent Boston\nsuburban communities that may still vote for moderate Republicans like\nCharlie Baker, but voted in large numbers for Hillary Clinton in 2016\nand by even larger margins for Joe Biden in 2020.\nThe towns that have moved the most towards the GOP since 1972 are\nAchushent (-60), Millville (-56), Ware (-52), and (Dudley -49).\nThe towns that have moved the most in the Democratic direction are\nMount Washington (+101), Alford (+85), Gosnold (+83), and Shelburne\n(+80).\nRegardless of national trends, there is little sign that Massachusetts\nwill become universally blue and that some towns will remain\nsympathetic to Republican candidates and conservative attitudes.\n\n\n\n",

The State Representative\nrace that looked like it would be the most competitive based on our\nfundamentals-based model (1st Middlesex) did turn out incredibly close\nand has not yet been called. Another race that looked reasonably safe\n(2nd Essex) ended up closer than expected and has not been called by\nthe AP. A State Senate race that looked close from a fundamentals\npoint of view (Hampden, Hampton and Worcester) came down safely in\nDemocratic territory, as did a race where pundits felt GOP strength\nmight win out (Norfolk, Worcester and Middlesex).\n1st Middlesex\nThe model expected a\nnail-biter\nin the 1st Middlesex State Representative race between Margaret\nScarsdale (D-Pepperell), Andrew Shepherd (R-Townsend), and independent\ncandidate Catherine Lundeen (I-Pepperell) and nail-biter is what we\ngot. As of this writing, Shepherd looks to be ahead by 34 votes out of\n19,633 votes cast, a margin of 0.17 percentage points. The race seems\nto be headed for a recount.\n2nd Essex\nThe biggest surprise of the night was the tight margin in the 2nd\nEssex State Representative race between incumbent Rep. Leonard Mirra\n(R-Georgetown) and challenger Kristin Kassner (D-Hamilton). The model\nexpected a high-single digit two-party margin in favor of Mirra, but\nthe current count shows a tiny 84 vote lead out of 23,114 votes case,\na margin of 0.36 percentage points. This race has also not been\nofficially called by the Associated Press. The results are still\ninside the 90% error bars of the model, but it is an outlier.\nHampden, Hampton and Worcester\nOn the State Senate side our model rated the Hampden, Hampton and\nWorcester District—the post-redistricting version of the\ndistrict represented by Lt. Governor candidate Eric Lesser\n(D-Longmeadow)—as the most competitive race. A reader who\nunderstood the specifics of this race gave the\nopinion\nthat State Rep. Oliveira (D-Ludlow) held a strong advantage over\nbusiness person William Johsnon (R-Granby) based on the structure of\nthe district and the influence of Oliveira’s State Representative\ndistrict. Tuesday’s result seemed to bear that out with Oliveira\ngetting 56% of the two-party vote, not close, but still well within\nthe 90% confidence interval of the model.\nNorfolk, Worcester and Middlesex\nI took a fairly close\nlook\nat the Norfolk, Worcester and Middlesex state senate race between\nincumbent Senator Becca Rausch (D-Needham) and sitting State\nRep. Shawn Dooley (R-Norfolk). There seemed to be some conventional\nwisdom that the race would be close because of the red-to-purple\nreputation of the district in its previous incarnation as the Norfolk,\nWorcester and Bristol with former GOP State Senators Richard Ross\n(R-Wrentham) and Scott Brown (R-Wrentham).\nHowever, the district is full of towns that have swung in the\nDemocratic\ndirection\nsince the Trump era. This swing pushed the model to have high\nexpectations of a Rausch win. Rausch’s victory with 55% of the\ntwo-party vote was fairly comfortable, and could have been higher if\nnot for the strong name recognition of Rep. Dooley in the area and the\nlarge amount of\nmoney\nspent on boths sides. It is hard to see this district as purple\nanymore with its D+12 Partisan Voter Index.\n\n\nContested State Rep results\n    district\n      PVI\n      Incumbent\n      Winner\n      Margin\n      \n

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a great deal of interest in the MA State Senate race\nfor the Norfolk, Worcester and Middlesex District with incumbent\nSenator Becca Rausch (D-Needham) and challenger State Representative\nShawn Dooley (R-Norfolk). The previous version of this State Senate\ndistrict—the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex—had been\nconsidered solidly Republican and was represented by Republican\nRichard Ross (R-Wrentham) who was ousted by Rausch in 2018, and\nrepresented by Scott Brown (R-Wrentham) before Brown was elected to\nthe United States Senate in 2010.\nOur simple, fundamentals-based model gives Rausch a very high\nprobability of winning with a range of likely outcomes from a single\ndigit Democratic margin to a major blowout. The major reason for this\nchange in circumstances is a continual multi-year shift from\nRepublican to Democratic strength in the affluent and well-educated\nBoston suburbs.\nRegional Partisan Shifts\nThe rise of Donald Trump as the face of the Rebpulican party in the\nUnited States has led to a profound shift in levels of Democratic and\nRepublican support in many areas of Massachusetts. This was evident\nafter the 2016 presidential election as described in a thoughtful\ninvestigation by WGBH’s Adam Reilly\nsupported by a Mass. Numbers analysis.\nThe process has continued with the 2020 election as well-educated and\naffluent suburbs have continued their move towards the Democratic\nParty and away from a Trump-led GOP. There has also been a shift in\nthe rightward direction with much higher levels of support for\nRepublicans in rural areas with more non-college voters and also in\nthe gateway cities with large population of Hispanic (Lawrence) and\nPortugese (Fall River, New Bedford) voter ancestry.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: State Senate partisan shifts 2012-2020\n\n\n\nThis map of partisan shift from 2012 to 2020 presidential elections by\nstate senate district gives a strong picture of which areas are moving\nin the Democratic direction (affluent suburbs of Boston) and in the\nRepublican direction (rural areas and gateway cities). Note that many\nof the gateway cities still vote in large majorities for Democrats,\nbut the margins have come down significantly.\nImpact of shifts on State Senate race\nThe pre-2021 Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex State Senate District\nrepresented by Becca Rausch (D-Needham) is in second place behind the\nThird Middlesex District of Michael Barrett (D-Lexington), with\nrespective shifts of 14 and 13 points in the Democratic direction\nbetween 2012 and 2020. However, the Third Middlesex District has\ngone from an already-very-blue 60% Democratic vote share to a\nmuch higher 74%, while the Rausch district was within Republican\nstriking distance at 54% in 2012, but has moved to a 67% Democratic\nshare in 2020.\nThese shifts often have important ramifications on the results of\ndown-ballot state legislative races, which are reflected in our\nfundamentals-based model using the Partisan Voter Index (PVI) which\nis an average of the last two presidential races, adjusted by\nthe nationwide result.\nAn examination of the model’s characterization of the races in the\nNorfolk, Bristol and Middlesex District for 2016, 2018, and 2020, and\nthe similar Norfolk, Worcester and Middlesex District for 2022,\nshow how the playing field has changed. The model’s adjustment\nfor non-presidential years would have significantly reduced\nSenator Rausch’s chances in 2022 compared to 2020 if it had\nnot been for the continuing shift of the region towards\nDemocratic candidates in the 2020 election which raised\nthe PVI from D+6 to D+12, giving Rausch about the same range\nof outcomes in 2022 as in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Norfolk, {Bristol, Worcester}, Middlesex model vs. outcome\n\n\n\n\n\nNorfolk, {Bristol, Worcester}, Middlsex model vs. outcome\n    year\n      incumbent\n      pres_year\n      candidates\n      result\n      pred_dem_margin\n      margin_low\n      margin_high\n    2016\nGOP\nTRUE\nRoss (R) over Aleksov (D)\n−20%\n−10%\n−33%\n12%2018\nGOP\nFALSE\nRausch (D) over Ross (R)\n3%\n−14%\n−36%\n8%2020\nDem\nTRUE\nRausch (D) over Kelly (R)\n20%\n29%\n8%\n52%2022\nDem\nFALSE\nRausch (D) vs. Dooley (R)\n\n29%\n7%\n51%\n\nWhile a win by State Representative Shawn Dooley (R-Norfolk) is not an\nimpossible outcome, the profound shift of the Boston suburbs away\nfrom the Republican Party make a win by incumbent Becca Rausch\nmuch more likely.\n\n\n\n",

The other 30 percent of the variance is due to important factors\nlike candidate and campaign quality, which will determine the results in\ncompetitive races. The general, fundamentals-based nature of the model is also\nwhy these ratings should only be used to understand the competitive landscape\nrather than as a prediction of race results.\nAs an example, let’s take the Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester race\nbetween sitting State Representative Jake Oliveira (D-Ludlow) and\nbusiness owner William Johnson (R-Granby). The Partisan Voter Index\n(PVI) of the redistricted Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester district is\nD+4 (3.50 with more precision) meaning that over the last two\npresidential elections the district is 3.5 points more Democratic than\nthe country as a whole. The incumbency variable is set to no incumbent\nas State Senator Eric Lesser (D-Longmeadow) ran for Lt. Governor,\nrather than for re-election. The presidential election variable is\nfalse, as it is for all the 2022, off-year races.\nUsing the trained model to probabilistically simulate the election\nseveral thousand times (sampling from the posterior distribution in\ntechnical parlance) we see the Oliveira winning 59% of the time, and\nJohnson winning 41% of the time. If we look at the simulated\nDemocratic percent of the vote, rather than the win/loss percentage,\nwe see an average Democratic percent of 52% of the vote—making\nthis the most competitive State Senate seat with respect to this\nmodel. We can also generate a 90% confidence interval for the margin\nwith the Democratic percentage varying from 41% to 63%—a wide\nenough interval to allow for a comfortable GOP win, or a large\nDemocratic victory. The most likely outcome will be a reasonably\nnarrow victory for Oliveira or Johnson.\nRace Ratings\nFor each race we show the candidates, district Partisvan Voter Index (PVI),\nand the output of the model: a Democratic win probability, and a projected\nDemocratic one-way margin (points above 50/50 tie) with a 90% confidence\ninterval. It is important to remember that this fundamentals-based model\ndoes not take into account particulars of each race including important\nfactors like candidate quality and campaign efforts and outreach, which will\nactually determine the results in competitive races.\nIn races with a Republican, a third-party, unenrolled, or independent\ncandidate, and no Democratic candidate, the Democratic win percentage\nand margin should be attributed to the non-Republican candidate.\nThe highlighted races in the table have both candidates with at least\na 10% chance of winning and non-trivial margins on both sides of the\nbreak-even margin line.\n\n\nContested State Senate race ratings\n    district\n      PVI\n      Incumbent\n      D\n      R\n      other\n      dem_win_prob\n      margin\n    First Plymouth and Norfolk\nD+9\nGOP\nStephens (D-Hanson)\nO'Connor (R-Weymouth)\n\n8%\n06-16First Essex and Middlesex\nD+10\nGOP\n\nTarr (R-Gloucester)\nCudney (I-Gloucester)\n10%\n07-15Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester\nD+4\n\nOliveira (D-Ludlow)\nJohnson (R-Granby)\n\n59%\n013-9Third Bristol and Plymouth\nR+1\nDem\nPacheco (D-Taunton)\nCollins (R-Taunton)\n\n80%\n017-6Worcester and Hampshire\nEVEN\nDem\nGobi (D-Spencer)\nAmorello (R-Holden)\n\n82%\n017-5First Bristol and Plymouth\nD+1\nDem\nRodrigues (D-Westport)\nProtentis (R-Lakeville)\n\n85%\n018-4Plymouth and Barnstable\nD+4\nDem\nMoran (D-Falmouth)\nMacrae (R-Bourne)\n\n91%\n020-2Hampden and Hampshire\nD+6\nDem\nVelis (D-Westfield)\nCalabrese (R-Agawam)\n\n93%\n021-2Second Essex and Middlesex\nD+6\nDem\nFinegold (D-Andover)\nDefranco (R-Haverhill)\n\n94%\n021-1Worcester and Middlesex\nD+8\nDem\nCronin (D-Lunenburg)\nHoyt (R-Westford)\n\n95%\n0220Bristol and Norfolk\nD+8\nDem\nFeeney (D-Foxborough)\nChaisson (R-Foxborough)\nSaylor (W-Mansfield)\n96%\n0231First Worcester\nD+17\n\nKennedy (D-Worcester)\n\nMair (U-Berlin)\n95%\n0241Norfolk and Plymouth\nD+9\nDem\nKeenan (D-Quincy)\nInnes (R-Hanover)\n\n96%\n0241Berkshire, Hampden, Franklin and Hampshire\nD+18\n\nMark (D-Becket)\n\nPhair (U-Pittsfield)\n95%\n0242Norfolk, Plymouth and Bristol\nD+11\nDem\nTimilty (D-Milton)\nMuello (R-Braintree)\n\n97%\n0252Norfolk, Worcester and Middlesex\nD+12\nDem\nRausch (D-Needham)\nDooley (R-Wrentham)\n\n98%\n0263Second Essex\nD+12\nDem\nLovely (D-Salem)\nAnketell (R-Peabody)\n\n98%\n0264Cape and Islands\nD+12\nDem\nCyr (D-Truro)\nLauzon (R-Barnstable)\n\n98%\n0273Third Essex\nD+13\nDem\nCrighton (D-Lynn)\n\nSulustri (I-Swampscott)\n98%\n0264Second Plymouth and Norfolk\nD+14\nDem\nBrady (D-Brockton)\nGordon (R-Hanson)\n\n98%\n0275Fifth Middlesex\nD+16\nDem\nLewis (D-Winchester)\nDombroski (R-Wakefield)\n\n99%\n0297Middlesex and Worcester\nD+20\nDem\nEldridge (D-Acton)\nChristakis (R-Wayland)\n\n99%\n03210\n\n\n\n\n",

The model is trained with\n424 state legislative elections from 2008 through 2021 and explains a\nlittle over 70 percent of variance in the Democratic percentage of the\nvote. The other 30 percent of the variance is due to important factors\nlike candidate and campaign quality, which will determine the results in\ncompetitive races. The general, fundamentals-based nature of the model\nis also why these ratings should only be used to understand the\ncompetitive landscape rather than as a prediction of race results.\nThe model does not adjust for third-party, independent, or unenrolled\ncandidates, as a simple treatment of the third candidate as an\nadditional model parameter does not provide additional explanatory\nvalue. An improved model might treat different types of third-party,\nindependent, and unenrolled candidates differently, depending on their\nrole with respect to the other candidate(s) (challenge from the left for\nDemocrat, libertarian challenge to establishment Republican, etc.). This\nwould require investigation and classification of each individual\nhistorical race, and each race being put through the model for inference\npurposes. We are considering adding additional features to the model\nthat do not require this type of manual coding, including length of\nincumbency tenure, and an adjustment for a candidate home town\neffect.\nThe Bayesian regression model allows us to interpret the results in a\nprobabilistic context and also provides easily interpretable confidence\nintervals. If you are interested in the technical details you can check\nout the source\ncode and data for this post.\nAs an example, let’s take the 1st Middlesex race between Margaret\nScarsdale (D-Pepperell), Andrew Shephard (R-Townsend), and independent\ncandidate Catherine Lundeen of Pepperell. The Partisan Voter Index (PVI)\nof the redistricted 1st Middlesex District is D+2 (or 2.27 with a bit\nmore precision) meaning that over the last two presidential elections\nthe district is 2.27 points more Democratic than the country as a whole.\nThe incumbency variable is set to no incumbent as former 1st Middlesex\nRep. Sheila Harrington (R-Groton) left the state house to become Clerk\nMagistrate of the Gardner District Court. The presidential election\nvariable is false, as it is for all the 2022, off-year races.\nIf we use the trained model to probabilistically simulate the\nelection several thousand times (sampling from the posterior\ndistribution in technical parlance) we see the Democrat winning 53%\nof the time, and the Republican 47% of the time. If we look at the\nsimulated Democratic percent of the vote, rather than the win/loss\npercentage, we see an average Democratic percent of 51% of the\nvote—making this the most competitive State Rep seat with respect to\nthis model. We can also generate a 90% onfidence interval for the voting\nresult with the Democratic percentage varying from 40% to 62%—a wide\nenough interval to allow for a comfortable GOP win, or a large\nDemocratic victory. The most likely outcome will be a reasonably narrow\nvictory for Scarsdale or Shephard.\nRace Ratings\nFor each race we show the candidates, district Partisvan Voter Index\n(PVI), and the output of the model: a Democratic win probability, and a\nprojected Democratic one-way margin (points above 50/50 tie) with a 90%\nconfidence interval. It is important to remember that this\nfundamentals-based model does not take into account particulars of each\nrace including important factors like candidate quality and campaign\nefforts and outreach, which will actually determine the results in\ncompetitive races.\nThe one race that needs to be interpreted differently is the 2nd\nFranklin race between Susannah Whipps (I-Athol) and Jeffrey Raymond\n(R-Athol). We are treating Whipps as an incumbent Democrat, with respect\nto the model, given that she has a Republican opponent. It would have\nmade sense to treat her as a Republican incumbent if she had a\nDemocratic opponent.\nThe highlighted races in the table have both candidates with at least\na 10% chance of winning and non-trivial margins on both sides of the\nbreak-even margin line.\n\n\nContested State Rep race ratings\n    district\n      PVI\n      Incumbent\n      D\n      R\n      other\n      dem_win_prob\n      margin\n    3rd Hampden\nR+7\nGOP\nRusso (D-Agawam)\nBoldyga (R-Southwick)\n\n0%\n0-5-288th Plymouth\nR+1\nGOP\nHaikola (D-Raynham)\nD'Emilia (R-Bridgewater)\n\n1%\n0-2-247th Plymouth\nR+1\nGOP\n\nSullivan (R-Abington)\nGriffin (W-Whitman)\n1%\n0-1-247th Worcester\nR+1\nGOP\n\nFrost (R-Auburn)\nDotson (U-Millbury)\n1%\n0-1-235th Plymouth\nEVEN\nGOP\nDockter (D-Hanover)\nDecoste (R-Norwell)\n\n2%\n00-2322nd Middlesex\nD+1\nGOP\nEnglish (D-Billerica)\nLombardo (R-Billerica)\n\n2%\n00-221st Plymouth\nD+3\nGOP\nPalmer (D-Plymouth)\nMuratore (R-Plymouth)\n\n3%\n02-201st Bristol\nD+6\nGOP\nRoche (D-Mansfield)\nBarrows (R-Mansfield)\n\n5%\n04-183rd Barnstable\nD+6\nGOP\nAlfano (D-Bourne)\nVieira (R-Falmouth)\n\n5%\n04-182nd Essex\nD+9\nGOP\nKassner (D-Hamilton)\nMirra (R-Georgetown)\n\n8%\n06-1611th Worcester\nD+12\nGOP\nFishman (D-Shrewsbury)\nKane (R-Shrewsbury)\n\n14%\n09-131st Middlesex\nD+2\n\nScarsdale (D-Pepperell)\nShepherd (R-Townsend)\nLundeen (I-Pepperell)\n53%\n012-108th Hampden\nD+4\n\nArriaga (D-Chicopee)\n\nGoonan (I-Chicopee)\n61%\n013-836th Middlesex\nR+3\nDem\nGarry (D-Dracut)\nBoag (R-Dracut)\n\n72%\n014-89th Norfolk\nD+6\n\nKalkut (D-Norfolk)\nVaughn (R-Wrentham)\n\n68%\n014-87th Hampden\nD+6\n\nSaunders (D-Belchertown)\nHarrington (R-Ludlow)\n\n71%\n015-78th Bristol\nR+2\nDem\nSchmid (D-Westport)\nGendreau (R-Westport)\n\n76%\n016-714th Essex\nD+8\n\nRamos (D-North Andover)\nFinn (R-North Andover)\n\n76%\n016-65th Bristol\nR+1\nDem\nHaddad (D-Somerset)\nThurber (R-Somerset)\n\n80%\n017-62nd Worcester\nR+1\nDem\nZlotnik (D-Gardner)\nChester (R-Gardner)\n\n81%\n016-619th Middlesex\nEVEN\nDem\nRobertson (D-Wilmington)\nSarnowski (R-Wilmington)\n\n82%\n017-51st Barnstable\nD+9\n\nFlanagan (D-Dennis)\nPost (R-Yarmouth)\nKasparian (WTP-Yarmouth)\n79%\n017-512th Plymouth\nD+1\nDem\nLanatra (D-Kingston)\nMeschino (R-Plymouth)\nMccoy (NP-Kingston)\n84%\n018-516th Middlesex\nD+11\n\nElliott (D-Lowell)\nMiller (R-Lowell)\n\n84%\n018-310th Bristol\nD+2\nDem\nStraus (D-Mattapoisett)\nSwift (R-Mattapoisett)\n\n88%\n018-46th Plymouth\nD+3\nDem\nCutler (D-Duxbury)\nSweezey (R-Hanson)\n\n88%\n019-31st Essex\nD+12\n\nShand (D-Newburyport)\nFitzwater (R-Salisbury)\n\n88%\n020-24th Worcester\nD+5\nDem\nHiggins (D-Leominster)\n\nDombrowski (U-Leominster)\n93%\n021-23rd Bristol\nD+5\nDem\nDoherty (D-Taunton)\nCoute (R-Taunton)\n\n93%\n021-12nd Bristol\nD+6\nDem\nHawkins (D-Attleboro)\nEscobar (R-Attleboro)\n\n93%\n021-12nd Barnstable\nD+6\nDem\nDiggs (D-Barnstable)\nPeters (R-Barnstable)\n\n93%\n021-12nd Franklin\nD+6\nDem1\nWhipps (I-Athol)\nRaymond (R-Athol)\nMckeown (U-Gill)\n93%\n021-112th Worcester\nD+6\nDem\nKilcoyne (D-Clinton)\nVulcano (R-Northborough)\n\n93%\n021-14th Norfolk\nD+7\nDem\nMurphy (D-Weymouth)\nRotondo (R-Weymouth)\n\n95%\n02209th Plymouth\nD+8\nDem\nCassidy (D-Brockton)\nNovak (R-Brockton)\n\n95%\n02208th Middlesex\nD+17\n\nArena-Derosa (D-Holliston)\nBarnes (R-Millis)\n\n94%\n023110th Norfolk\nD+9\nDem\nRoy (D-Franklin)\nBailey (R-Franklin)\n\n96%\n02413rd Worcester\nD+9\nDem\nKushmerek (D-Fitchburg)\nPackard (R-Fitchburg)\n\n96%\n024219th Worcester\nD+18\n\nDonaghue (D-Westborough)\nHostage (R-Southborough)\n\n95%\n023118th Essex\nD+10\nDem\nNguyen (D-Andover)\nDufour (R-Tewksbury)\n\n97%\n024214th Middlesex\nD+22\n\nCataldo (D-Concord)\nCleaves (R-Chelmsford)\n\n97%\n027531st Middlesex\nD+13\nDem\nDay (D-Stoneham)\n\nMenounos (I-Winchester)\n98%\n02752nd Middlesex\nD+14\nDem\nArciero (D-Westford)\nXie (R-Westford)\n\n98%\n027617th Worcester\nD+15\nDem\nLeboeuf (D-Worcester)\nFullen (R-Worcester)\n\n99%\n02862nd Norfolk\nD+15\nDem\nChan (D-Quincy)\nCintolo (R-Quincy)\n\n99%\n02965th Essex\nD+16\nDem\nFerrante (D-Gloucester)\nSullivan (R-Gloucester)\n\n99%\n02978th Norfolk\nD+17\nDem\nPhilips (D-Sharon)\nTerban (R-Stoughton)\n\n99%\n029711th Suffolk\nD+28\n\nGarcia (D-Chelsea)\nTaylor (R-Chelsea)\n\n99%\n031928th Middlesex\nD+20\nDem\nMcgonagle (D-Everett)\n\nMarchese (U-Everett)\n99%\n03293rd Berkshire\nD+23\nDem\nPignatelli (D-Lenox)\n\nLavery (GR-Becket)\n100%\n0351214th Norfolk\nD+25\nDem\nPeisch (D-Wellesley)\n\nRolde (GR-Weston)\n100%\n036145th Suffolk\nD+42\n\nWorrell (D-Boston)\n\nOwens (I-Boston)\n100%\n043201 Whipps is independent, but is treated as an incumbent Democrat for modeling this race.\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

The candidates on the ballot were Kim Driscoll, mayor of\nSalem, Tami Gouveia of Acton, State Representative for the 14th\nMiddlesex District, and Eric Lessor of Longmeadow, State Senator for the\n1st Hampden and Hampshire District. Another Western Massachusetts State\nSenator, Adam Hinds (D-Pittsfield), was in the early running, but failed\nto get the requisite 15% support at the Democratic convention in\nWorcester in early June.\nMayor Driscoll earned\nthe endorsement of the state party at the convention, and held a name\nrecognition and preference lead over Lesser and Gouveia throughout\nmuch of the primary. Driscoll was also able to secure some Western\nMassachusetts support after Adam Hinds left the race, securing\nnominations from the mayors of Pittsfield and Easthampton.\nSenator Lesser came into the race with high hopes and a great deal of\nnational Democratic support, having served in the Obama administration\nas Special Assistant to Senior Advisor David Axelrod. While Lesser\ncalled on his famous White House colleagues for help with fundraising\nand volunteer recruiting, he wasn’t able to make major inroads in the\nnon-western parts of the Commonwealth.\nRepresentative Gouveia was a favorite of progressive\nactivists but had even more trouble with name recognition and\ngeographic reach beyond the Route 2 corridor of Concord, Acton,\nLittleton, and Harvard.\nMeasuring Geographic Reach\nWhile the winning candidate map gives us an intuitive sense of each\ncandidate’s geographic reach, I found it useful to quantify the reach by\nfinding the distances between each candidate’s home community and all of\nthe cities and towns where that candidate won the plurality of the vote.\nTaking the community with the maximum distance gives an idea of each\ncandidate’s geographic reach. I am ignoring several outlier towns for\nDriscoll and Lesser that aren’t contiguously attached to the other\nsupported areas.\n\n\nTable 2: Candidate geographic reach\n\n\nname\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nfarthest_win\n\n\nwin_distance\n\n\nKim Driscoll\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nNantucket\n\n\n95 [mi]\n\n\nEric Lesser\n\n\nLongmeadow\n\n\nWilliamstown\n\n\n55 [mi]\n\n\nTami Gouveia\n\n\nActon\n\n\nChelmsford\n\n\n9 [mi]\n\n\nWhile Driscoll’s maximum reach community was Nantucket, you can also\nsee her range by her wins in Warwick, MA (74 miles) in Franklin County\nand Southbridge, MA (66 miles) near the western edge of Worcester County\nwith only Sturbridge as a buffer between Lesser’s home county of\nHampden.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Winner of MA Lt. Governor Democratic\nPrimary w/distances\n\n\n\nKim Driscoll Vote Share\nThe Driscoll vote share map shows incredible strength on the North\nShore in Essex County, as you would expect. While the percentages are\nnot quite as large as Lesser’s in his home district towns, the larger\ncommunity sizes lead to much higher total margins. The only weak areas\nfor Driscoll in Middlesex County are the Route 2 corridor towns of\nGouveia’s home district@mdash;while Driscoll maintains a second place\nstanding in those towns.\nDriscoll took 50% of Boston with Lesser and Gouveia splitting the\nremaining 50% and remained strong in Worcester County, the South Shore,\nand on the Cape and the Islands.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kim Driscoll vote share MA Lt.

The incumbent of the existing and similarly named Berkshire, Hampshire, Franklin and Hampden district, Adam Hinds (D-Pittsfield) ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor, leaving this district without an incumbent senator.\nThe Democratic primary will feature sitting State Representative Paul Mark (D-Becket) whose current Second Berkshire State Representative district is outlined in the map, and Williamstown former small business owner and local municipal board member Huff Templeton III. Representative Mark will have an advantage as about 20% of the Senate district’s Democratic primary voters will have seen him on the ballot (using an average of vote totals from previous elections), and likely will have voted for him in the past.\nThe D+18 Partisan Voter Index (PVI) will make the winner of the Democratic primary the prohibitive favorite in November’s general election against unenrolled candidate Brendan Phair of Pittsfield.\nHampden, Hampshire and Worcester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hampden, Hampshire and Worcesterm\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nN\n\n\nSydney R.

It is the only state senate seat to feature both a Democratic and Republican primary in 2022.\nOn the Democratic side, first term State Representative Jacob Oliveira (D-Ludlow) faces campaign strategist Sydney Levin-Epstein of Longmeadow. The dashed line on map shows the overlap of the Oliveira-held Seventh Hampden State Rep district.\nOliveira comes off a hotly contested State Rep win where he defeated Republican James “Chip” Harrington by 134 votes after a recount. Perennial candidate Harrington is running for state rep again against Democrat Aaron Saunders of Belchertown.\nLevin-Epstein served as Deputy Finance Director for Ed Markey’s 2020 re-election campaign and is bringing her political organizing experience to bear on her own campaign this year.\nThe two GOP candidates are John Harding of East Longmeadow, a former military office, and William Johnson, a business owner from Granby.\nFirst Worcester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Hampden, Hampshire and Worcesterm\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: First Worcester candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nN\n\n\nRobyn K.

There are two Democrats vying for the Democratic nomination in the First Worcester district, comprised of much of Worcester, Boylston, West Boylston, Northborough, Berlin, and Bolton.\nRobyn Kennedy of Worcester is the Executive Director or the YWCA of Central Massachusetts and has the backing of former Governor Deval Patrick and his Worcester-based Lt. Governor Tim Murray.\nJoseph Petty has been serving as the mayor of Worcester since 2012 and has gained the endorsement of Senator Ed Markey.\nDespite the Markey endorsement for Petty, Kennedy has been getting support from many of the more progressive groups. Petty has been running on his experience, presenting an establishment candidate message.\nPetty started with $48,859 in his mayoral campaign account when he changed its purpose to the State Senate seat in February, 2022, giving him a big head start over Kennedy who was starting from scratch. Kennedy has since raised approximately two thirds as much as Petty, spent about half, and had about 40% of Petty’s cash on hand as of the end of July.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face undeclared candidate Lisa Mair of Berlin who is running on a platform of informed medical consent and lower taxes. The Democrat will have a strong advantage in this D+17 district.\nFirst Essex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: First Essex Senate Districtm\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: First Essex candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nN\n\n\nPavel Payano\n\n\nD\n\n\nLawrence\n\n\n$58,892\n\n\n$32,622\n\n\n$44,228\n\n\nN\n\n\nDoris V.

There is no incumbent senator running as Diana DiZoglio (D-Methuen) is running for auditor.\nPavel Payano is an at-large City Councilor in Lawrence; Doris Rodriguiez is a tax layer from Lawrence with public and private sector experience; and Eunice Zeigler is a City Councilor from Methuen. Payano and Zeigler have been able to raise and spend similar amounts of campaign funds.\nA look at the total number of votes from each of the cities in the precincts contained in the First Essex District show that over 50% of the votes come from Lawrence, while 26% come from Methuen, and 23% from Haverhill, giving the Lawrence candidates somewhat of an advantage.\n\n\nTable 6: First Essex vote distribution 2016/2020 presidential\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nvotes\n\n\npercent\n\n\nHaverhill\n\n\n1,321,958\n\n\n23%\n\n\nLawrence\n\n\n2,884,272\n\n\n51%\n\n\nMethuen\n\n\n1,442,136\n\n\n26%\n\n\nSecond Essex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Second Essex State Senate Districtm\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Second Essex candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nY\n\n\nJoan B.

Anketell\n\n\nR\n\n\nPeabody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Majority Leader Joan Lovely (D-Salem) faces a primary challenge from Kyle Davis of Danvers. Davis has pursued a career as an artist and performer, supporting himself with day jobs as a waiter and food delivery driver, and is running in a attempt to diversify the legislature with people from atypical political backgrounds.\nSenator Lovely’s fundraising isn’t particularly strong for an incumbent State Senator, but challenger Davis’s numbers are weaker than they appear based on totals. The $27-28,000 raised and spent numbers seem reasonable until you look at the particulars. There was a mistaken transfer into the account of $15,000 (since transfered out) and a mistaken personal expense written as a check from the account for $2,483 (since returned), combined with candidate loans to the campaign of $2,400 and $1,500 which brings the actual amount raised from non-candidate sources to $6,185.\nThe winner for the Democratic primary will face Republican Damian Anketell who seems to have previously run for Essex County Sheriff as a Democrat. Anketell has been featured at Mass. GOP events promoted by Howie Carr to get a referendum question on the ballot to deny drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants. Anketell has made the extraordinary move of filling out Office of Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF) from CPF D104 which states that he will not raise or expend campaign funds in this race.\nThe D+12 district will likely go to the Democrat, regardless of primary outcome, but the incumbency advantage of Lovely would make it highly unlikely for a GOP pickup, especially with the promise of no money raised or spent by the GOP candidate.\nSecond Suffolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Second Suffolk State Senate Districtm\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Second Suffolk candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nN\n\n\nMiniard Culpepper\n\n\nD\n\n\nBoston\n\n\n$157,273\n\n\n$45,935\n\n\n$111,338\n\n\nN\n\n\nNika Elugardo\n\n\nD\n\n\nJamaica Plain\n\n\n$102,324\n\n\n$111,936\n\n\n$10,545\n\n\nN\n\n\nJames E.

There are five candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, although James Grant does not seem to pursuing a strong campaign, raising money, or participating in debates. The primary winner will take office in January, given that no non-Democratic candidates qualified for the race, not to mention its status as the most Democratic Massachusetts state senate district with a whopping PVI of D+42.\nThere are two sitting State Representatives in the race for the Second Suffolk. Nika Elguardo (D-Jamaica Plain) represents the 15th Suffolk State Representative District (dotted outline in the map), and Liz Miranda (D-Boston) represents the 5th Suffolk State Representative District (dashed outline in the map). Neither of these state representative districts overlaps with Second Suffolk State Senate district to a large extent.\nMiniard Culpepper is a Baptist minister, lawyer, community activist, and former regional counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nDiane Wilkerson is a former State Senator who plead guitly to extortion charges and spent two and a half years in prison. Wilkerson is attempting to make a political comeback, counting on voters to forgive the transgressions for which she has paid a steep price.\nCulpepper, Elugardo, and Miranda have all raised serious amounts of campaign money. Miranda wins the fundraising and spending titles so far, having raised $172,074 and spent $188,753. Elugardo has raised $102,324 and spent $111,936 this year. Culpepper raised more than Elugardo in the same period, $157,273, but has only spent $45,935. It is not quite to the point as of July 31 filing that having Culpepper’s $111,338 left in the bank is a liability, but the closer it gets to primary day, the less useful unspent dollars become.\nFirst Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: First Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: First Plymouth and Norfolk candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nHanson\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\nY\n\n\nPatrick Michael O’Connor\n\n\nR\n\n\nWeymouth\n\n\n$68,481\n\n\n$64,169\n\n\n$104,450\n\n\nN\n\n\nRonald J.

O’Connor is widely considered a moderate Republican in the Massachusetts vein. He did vote against the final version of the MA ROE Act, citing issues of expanding third trimester abortions and removal of most parental consent, but is a proponent of clean energy and universal full-day kindergarten.\nSenator O’Connor faces Marshfield Republican Ronald Patuto in the GOP primary. There isn’t a great deal of campaign information about Patuto on the internet, but a radio forum on WATD has Patuto arguing for less regulation of the lobstering business where he gets his livelihood, and against public school mask mandates.\nWhile I am not publishing model-based predictions for the primaries, this race is one where the general election model shows a big difference between the probability of a GOP general election win if O’Connor, the incumbent wins the primary (93% likelihood of GOP win), and if Patuto, the challenger wins the primary (21% likelihood of GOP win). This contrast demonstrates the power of incumbency and the fact that this moderate-for-MA state senate district (it is the 13th most Republican-leaning State Senate District) has as a Partisan Voter Index (PVI) of D+9, making it an easy-enough Democratic target without a moderate incumbent Republican on the ballot.\nHowever, the Democratic candidate for the First Plymouth and Norfolk District, Robert Stephens Jr. Hanson, is nowhere to be found on the internet and has not raised any campaign funds as of July 31.\nNorfolk, Plymouth and Bristol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Norfolk, Plymouth and Bristol District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Norfolk, Plymouth and Bristol candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nY\n\n\nWalter F.

One recent example would be his “No” vote on the MA ROE Act to expand and codify the right to an abortion in Massachusetts.\nTimilty’s challenger for the Democratic nomination is Kathleen Crogan-Camara who is running on a platform promoting disability rights, but is also challenging Timilty with a much more progressive view on issues like women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigrant rights. Crogan-Camara has gotten the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and has raised enough money to run a creditable campaign.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face another perennial candidate, Republican Brian Muello of Braintree who has run unsuccessfully for Mayor of Braintree, Braintree selectman, Braintree Town Clerk, and U.S. Senate.\nSecond Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Second Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11: Second Plymouth and Norfolk candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nY\n\n\nMichael D.

As mentioned in our redistricting post, the Second Plymouth and Norfolk district is also newly minted majority minority district with 49% White, 35% Black, 8% Hispanic, and 3% Asian in terms of voting age population. However, the black citizen voting age population is only 28% of the electorate, making this a difficult district for a black voting block to elect its candidate of choice.\nSenator Brady has weathered some challenges over the past several years, having been arrested for drunk driving in 2018 and being stripped of his committee chairmanship. Brady has since been re-instated to his leadership positions, presumably after serving out his probation with a dismissal of charges as per agreement.\nChallenger Katrina Huff-Larmond, a Randolph Town Councilor, is campaigning on change, leadership, a deeper connection with the people. In addition, Huff-Larmond participated in the redistricting process and created a more diverse senate district in the process. Huff-Larmond has raised $17,314 for the race so far, not insignificant, but still at a disadvantage to Brady’s larger and longer-term campaign funds.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Jim Gordon of Hanson who is running on a platform for parental review of educational material, restoring qualified immunity for law enforcement, and cutting taxes while increasing infrastructure spending. The simple model I use for estimating general election results based on PVI, incumbency, and whether it is a presidential voting year gives Gordon a 2 out of 100 chance of winning against Brady and a 1 out of 10 chance at beating Huff-Larmond.\nCape and Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Second Plymouth and Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 12: Cape and Islands candidates (year-to-date $)\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nreceipts\n\n\nspent\n\n\ncash\n\n\nY\n\n\nJulian Andre Cyr\n\n\nD\n\n\nTruro\n\n\n$105,481\n\n\n$54,105\n\n\n$290,804\n\n\nN\n\n\nDaralyn Andrea Heywood\n\n\nR\n\n\nWest Barnstable\n\n\n$17,140\n\n\n$9,066\n\n\n$8,074\n\n\nN\n\n\nChristopher Robert Lauzon\n\n\nR\n\n\nMills Village\n\n\n$12,106\n\n\n$9,664\n\n\n$2,443\n\n\nState Senator Julian Cyr is free from Democratic primary challengers in 2022, but will face the winner of a two-way Republican primary in November.

By looking at the predominant voting group in each Massachusetts precinct we see the opportunity and limits of what can be achieved in for Massachusetts State Senate districts.\nWhile there are six state senate districts that are technically majority-minority in the newly created districts, only three provide a particular minority voting block with the power to elect its candidate of choice, and that is the best that can be done given Massachusetts voter demographics.\nRedistricting Concepts\nThe Massachusetts State Senate lines have been redrawn by the legislature after the 2020 Census as required by the constitution. For a guide to the redistricting principles used by the state legislatures, a good reference is the Executive Summary of the Redistricting Red Book, published by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe primary responsibility given to redistricters by the constitution is to ensure equally-sized districts. For state legislatures, the courts have generally approved of redistricting plans where the largest and smallest districts are within 5 percent of the target population. The equal-size mandate results in the shifting of district lines as populations ebb and flow through the Commonwealth.\nThe next mandate for the redistricters comes from the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and relates to race, color, and minority language groups. While it is illegal to use race and ethnicity as factor in redistricting in the general case, it is also illegal to dilute concentrations of a minority voting block, resulting in that voting block not being able to elect its candidate of choice.\nWhile the short-hand concept of a majority-minority district is often used when evaluating redistricting plans, it is usually an oversimplification which does not addequately address minority voting block dilution. In particular, minority groups do not usually vote as a monolith. A district with 25% black voters and 30% hispanic voters is technically majority-minority, but gives neither the black voters nor the hispanic voters the ability to elect their preferred candidate. (In practice, redistricting bodies can use techniques like ecological regression to analyze and account for historical voting patterns and tendencies to understand the voting blocks in play.)\nThe newly drawn 2020-2021 Massachusetts State Senate districts increase the number of majority-minority districts from three to six, but only three of the districts contain a minority voting block with enough power to elect their candidate of choice. It is also clear from looking at the data that there aren’t enough geographically concentrated minority blocks in Massachusetts to do any better at this time.\nConcentrations of Minority Voting Blocks\nLet’s first look at the 2,152 voting precincts in Massachusetts by flagging any precinct that has a citizen voting age population (CVAP) for a minority group that is over 40% of the total citizen voting age population.\nWe use citizen voting age population because that is the actual number of people who are eligible to vote, a better determinant of voting power than total population. We will also use voting age population and overall population numbers when looking at specific districts, but CVAP makes sense as the number to consider for voting fairness.\n\n\nTable 1: Predominant voting group by voting precinct\n\n\nPredominant Group\n\n\nPrecinct Count\n\n\nPercent\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n1948\n\n\n91%\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n102\n\n\n5%\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n94\n\n\n4%\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n5\n\n\n0%\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n3\n\n\n0%\n\n\nIf we look at the municipality of the 203 voting precincts that have a critical mass of minority voters (102+94+5+3) it guides us towards which precincts might be grouped together into a single district to prevent dilution of that minority group’s voting power.\n\n\nTable 2: Number of plausibly minority precincts by city/town\n\n\nCity/Town\n\n\nPredominant Group\n\n\nPrecinct Count\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n71\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n29\n\n\nLawrence\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n24\n\n\nBrockton\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n18\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n12\n\n\nHolyoke\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n9\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n6\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n5\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nLowell\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n4\n\n\nLynn\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nWorcester\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n4\n\n\nBoston\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n2\n\n\nNew Bedford\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n2\n\n\nCambridge\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n1\n\n\nFramingham\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nHaverhill\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nLowell\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nMethuen\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nMilton\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n1\n\n\nQuincy\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n1\n\n\nRevere\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nSpringfield\n\n\nBlack_and_Hispanic\n\n\n1\n\n\nA statewide map of the precincts with concentrated minority representation shows the limited number and concentration of such districts.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Predominant group for all MA precincts\n\n\n\nA closer look at four of the clusters around Springfield, Lawrence, Boston, and Brockton show the biggest concentration of minority voting blocks. All but the Brockton/Randolph cluster have enough concentration to plausibly elect a minority candidate of choice.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cities with large minority voting blocks\n\n\n\nDistricts with Minority Power\nThe new Hampden, First Essex, and Second Suffolk Districts contain a large enough percentage of a particular minority group to allow for election of a candidate of choice by that minority group.\n\n\n\nThe Hampden District\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Hampden District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n168,062\n\n\n46%\n\n\n23%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n31%\n\n\n69%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n127,167\n\n\n41%\n\n\n22%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n36%\n\n\n64%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n117,532\n\n\n40%\n\n\n17%\n\n\n2%\n\n\n41%\n\n\n59%\n\n\nThe Hampden State Senate District contains 90 percent of Springfield’s precincts and 60 percent of Chicopee’s precincts. The district has about as many hispanic voters as non-hispanic white voters, giving that voting block a chance at electing their preferred candidate.\nThe pre-2021 version of the Hampden district had a similar characteristics. In 2020 Springfield City Councilor Alex Gomez defeated incumbent State Senator James Welch in the Democratic primary.\nA simple precinct-level ecological regression model that uses Gomez’s margin over Welch as the response variable and the CVAP hispanic percent and whether the voter is in Springfield as interacting explanatory variables ends up explaining 90 percent of the variation in the margin of the 2020 Hampden District Democratic primary vote. Hispanic voters were much more likely to vote for Gomez, especially those who lived in Springfield and might be familiar with Gomez from the City Council.\nThe First Essex District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: First Essex District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: First Essex District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n167,027\n\n\n59%\n\n\n11%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n32%\n\n\n68%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n126,539\n\n\n56%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n36%\n\n\n64%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n96,884\n\n\n47%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n47%\n\n\n53%\n\n\nThe First Essex District is the first successful attempt to create a majority hispanic Lawrence-based State Senate district by carving out largely hispanic precincts in Haverhill to add to Lawrence’s large hispanic population.\nThe district contains all of Lawrence, all of Methuen, and approximately 11 precincts of Haverhill (give or take a few census blocks). The new lines result in a voting age population that is 36% White, 56% Hispanic, 10% Black, and 3% Asian. There is an almost 10 point difference when looking at hispanic citizen voting age population, showing the large assimilation of immigrants, and somewhat limiting voting power.\nThe First Essex incumbent, Diana DiZoglio (D-Methuen), is running for Auditor, leaving an open race for a competitive field of candidates from Lawrence (Pavel Payano and Doris Rodriguez) and Methuen (Eunice Zeigler).\nThe Second Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Second Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Second Suffolk District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n181,874\n\n\n26%\n\n\n51%\n\n\n8%\n\n\n20%\n\n\n80%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n145,535\n\n\n24%\n\n\n48%\n\n\n8%\n\n\n23%\n\n\n77%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n124,934\n\n\n22%\n\n\n47%\n\n\n4%\n\n\n26%\n\n\n74%\n\n\nThe State Senate redistricting challenge in Boston is to create a district that gives candidate-of-choice power to black voters in Boston, whose numbers are large, but not large enough to give voting majorities in two districts. The 2020-2021 Senate redistricters shifted majority-black precincts from the First Suffolk District to the Second Suffolk, give a black citizen age voting population of 47%.\nThere is a very competitive 2022 Democratic primary for the Second Suffolk District featuring Miniard Culpepper, Nika Elugardo, Liz Miranda, and Dianne Wilkerson.\nThe remaining majority minority districts\nWhile there are three more majority-minority State Senate districts, none of contain a large enough block of minority voters to provide candidate of choice power to any one minority group.\nThe Second Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Second Plymouth and Norfolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Second Plymouth and Norfolk District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n172,727\n\n\n9%\n\n\n37%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n46%\n\n\n54%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n133,529\n\n\n8%\n\n\n35%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n49%\n\n\n51%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n112,378\n\n\n7%\n\n\n28%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n61%\n\n\n39%\n\n\nThe Second Plymouth and Norfolk District was a late-comer to the majority minority district additions during the latest redistricting process. The first draft of the senate redistricting plan left the Brockton-based district almost unchanged and grouped with the mostly white surrounding suburb of Hanover, Plympton and Easton. Pressure from redistricting advocacy groups led to a plan which extended the district through Avon into parts of Randolph that moved the demographics of the district into majority minority, while moving the white suburbs into adjacent districts.\nThe newly configured district has attracted an experienced Democratic challenger in Randolph Town Councilor Katrina Huff-Larmond who could increase the number of black women in the senate above one, Lydia Edward (D-Boston), if she were to win the primary on September 16th.\nThe First Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: First Suffolk District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n184,255\n\n\n13%\n\n\n25%\n\n\n16%\n\n\n46%\n\n\n54%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n156,555\n\n\n12%\n\n\n23%\n\n\n15%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n50%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n132,814\n\n\n11%\n\n\n23%\n\n\n11%\n\n\n55%\n\n\n45%\n\n\nThe First Suffolk District is currently represented by Nick Collins of South Boston. While the seat was held by Linda Dorcena Forry of Dorchester from 2013 through 2018, the demographics of the district are not particularly favorable for electing a black state senator. The 2020-2021 senate redistricting committe chose to shore up the Second Suffolk District to give its black voters the ability to elect their candidate of choice, leaving the First Suffolk with a black citizen voting age population of around 23%.\nThe Middlesex and Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Middlesex and Suffolk District\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Middlesex and Suffolk District Demographics\n\n\nstat\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nhispanic\n\n\nblack\n\n\nasian\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nminority\n\n\nTotal Population\n\n\n184,151\n\n\n27%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n14%\n\n\n42%\n\n\n58%\n\n\nVoting Age Population\n\n\n152,696\n\n\n24%\n\n\n12%\n\n\n15%\n\n\n46%\n\n\n54%\n\n\nCitizen Voting Age Population\n\n\n110,477\n\n\n17%\n\n\n12%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n61%\n\n\n39%\n\n\nThe Middelsex and Suffolk state senate district represented by Sal DiDomenico (D-Everett) has been redrawn adding sections of Cambridgeport and East Cambridge, while removing parts of Boston’s West End, Allston, and Brighton neighborhoods. While the overall population is 58% minority, the citizen voting age population is 39% minority and the largest minority voting block are hispanics at 17%.\nConclusion\nThe Massachusetts State Senate redistricting committee adhered to the letter and the spirit of the Voting Rights Act by doing its best to group together minority voting blocks and create districts with true minority voting power.\n\n\n\n",

Numbers blog began in November of 2012 with a post comparing Elizabeth Warren’s win over Scott Brown to Martha Coakley’s 2010 loss, observing that Warren’s largest gains came in working class cities like Holyoke, Lawrence, Chelsea, and Brockton.\nSome of the things that enabled posts like these were easily accessible fine-grained election results and a nice tool for creating interactive maps: Google Fusion Tables. As you might have seen by clicking on the first post, Google stopped supporting Google Fusion Tables in 2019.\nThis new version of the Mass. Numbers blog is enabled by some other new tools. The technologies of Rmarkdown, Distill, and GitHub Pages allow for creating data-driven blog posts that can be compiled into nice looking web pages, but also allow for including all of the data and analysis that appear in the post. This is exciting because it reduces the number of steps between analysis and publishing a result, but also because it promotes transparency, open data journalism, and reproducible data science.\nIf you read a post on this blog and are curious about how the analysis was done, you can look at the linked GitHub repository and see the .Rmd source of the post and the referenced data, checked in and versioned in the repository.\nOne other shout-out goes to the tmap mapping library that does Google Fusion Tables one better by making it easy to create data driven maps, both static maps and interactive maps, with a simple configuration option. The fact that I can create the maps completely with code allows for a great deal of automation, reducing the amount of manual work to create a map, and resulting in something that is documented and reproducible.\nI am guessing that most readers of this blog are interested in the political analysis and data visualizations, but I felt that it made sense to explain the evolution of the technology behind this writing and to help others who are interested in reproducing the results, or want to take the analysis in another direction.\nI am interested in your feedback. You can send me feedback through my @bwbensonjr twitter, or using the email address with username brent and the domain of this website.\n\n\n\n",
