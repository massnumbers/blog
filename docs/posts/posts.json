This post spends some time looking at redistricting, specifically the new majority minority state senate districts, and then at each of the contested state senate primaries.\nNew majority minority districts\nThe Massachusetts State Senate lines have been redrawn by the legislature after the 2020 Census as required by the constitution. Redistricting established two new majority minority districts.\nThe First Essex State Senate District—one of the new majority districts—contains all of Lawrence, all of Methuen, and about 5 precincts of Haverhill. The previous lines of the district left out Lawrence and included a large number of largely white communities. The new lines result in a voting age population that is 36% White, 56% Hispanic, 10% Black, and 3% Asian. The First Essex incumbent, Diana DiZoglio (D—Methuen), is running for Auditor, leaving an open race for a competitive field of candidates from Lawrence and Methuen (see the First Essex primary overview below).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: First Essex State Senate District\n\n\n\nThe other newly created majority minority is the Middlesex and Suffolk District with incumbent Sal DiDomenico (D—Everett). Redistricting has added diverse sections of Cambridgeport and East Cambridge, while removing parts of Boston’s West End, Allston, and Brighton neighborhoods. The district ends up with a demographic mix of 46% White, 24% Hispanic, 12% Black, and 15% Asian. DiDomenico does not have primary or general election challenger.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Middlesex and Suffolk State Senate District\n\n\n\nThe other majority minority State Senate districts are the Springfield-based Hampden district of Adam Gomez (D—Springfield), the Boston-based Second Suffolk district of Sonia Change-Diaz (D—Boston) who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor, and the Second Plymouth and Norfolk district with incumbent Senator Michael Brady (D—Brockton).\nThe full State Senate map is given here with dashed lines for previous State Senate district lines and some demographics (partisan lean, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: MA State Senate Districts (2022)\n\n\n\nState Senate Primary Overview\nThere are ten State Senate districts with contested primaries. There are three Democratic incumbents with primary challengers—Joan Lovely (D—Salem), Walter Timility (D—Milton), Michael Brady (D-Brockton)—and one Republican with a primary challenge, Patrick O’Connor (R-Weymouth).\nThere are five open seats with four having just a Democratic primary, and one seat—Hampden, Hampshire and Worcester—with both a Democratic and Republican primary.\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\nPVI\n\n\ninc_status\n\n\nIncumbent\n\n\nprimaries\n\n\nBerkshire, Hampden, Franklin and Hampshire\n\n\nD+18\n\n\nNo_Incumbent\n\n\n(Adam Hinds—Pittsfield)\n\n\nD\n\n\nHampden and Hampshire\n\n\nD+6\n\n\nDem_Incumbent\n\n\nJohn C.

Phair\n\n\nU\n\n\nPittsfield\n\n\nThe newly created and enormous Berkshire, Hampden, Franklin and Hampshire district contains 57 cities and towns in Western Massachusetts. The incumbent of the existing and similarly named Berkshire, Hampshire, Franklin and Hampden district, Adam Hinds (D—Pittsfield) ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor, leaving this district without an incumbent senator.\nThe Democratic primary will feature sitting State Representative Paul Mark (D—Peru) whose current Second Berkshire State Representative district is outlined in the map, and Williamstown small business manager and activist Huff Templeton III. Representative Mark will have a considerable advantage as almost a quarter of the Senate district’s Democratic primary voters will have seen him on the ballot, and likely will have voted for him in the past.\nThe D+18 Partisan Voter Index (PVI) will make the winner of the Democratic primary the prohibitive favorite in November’s general election against unenrolled candidate Brendan Phair of Pittsfield.\nHampden, Hampshire and Worcester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\n\n\ncpf_id\n\n\nInc\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\ncity_town\n\n\nHampden, Hampshire and Worcester\n\n\n17987\n\n\nN\n\n\nSydney R.

It is the only state senate seat to feature both a Democratic and Republican primary.\nOn the Democratic side, first term State Representative Jacob Oliveira (D—Ludlow) faces campaign strategist Sydney Levin-Epstein of Longmeadow. The map shows the overlap of the Oliveira-held Seventh Hampden State Rep district.\nThe two GOP candidates are John Harding of East Longmeadow, a former military office who says he has been called by God to run, and William Johnson, a business owner from Granby.\nFirst Worcester\nFirst Essex\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n",
