Congressman Seth Moulton (D-Salem) [has
announced](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/15/nation/seth-moulton-senate-ed-markey/)
that he will challenge Senator Ed Markey (D-Malden) in the 2026
Democratic primary for the United States Senate. Several potential
candidates have [already
announced](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/16/metro/an-open-seat-crowded-field-seth-moultons-senate-campaign-kicks-off-busy-campaign-cycle/)
their intention to run for the 6th Congressional seat, but many more
are likely to get in the race given how rarely congressional seats are
open.

This post will look at the 39 municipalities, 22 State Representative,
7 State Senate, and 3 Governor's Council districts that overlap the
6th Congressional district to consider a range of elected officials
who might consider a run for the seat. While the law does not require
that a Congressional candidate live in the district they are running
to represent, it is very rare for a candidate to break that norm. I
will focus on elected officials who live in the 6th district.

## District Overview

[![](sixth-cong-district.png){width="700"}](https://mapoli.us/districts/us-house/sixth.html)

The Massachusetts 6th Congressional District is "the North Shore
district," encompassing 31 of the 34 cities and towns of Essex County
and an additional eight Middlesex County towns. The only
municipalities that are not fully contained in the 6th District are
the Middlesex towns of Bedford and Billerica with 4 out of 5 Bedford
precincts and 5 out of 12 Billerica precincts sitting inside the 6th
Congressional District.

There are three notable northern Essex County cities that are not in
the 6th Congressional District&mdash;Haverhill, Lawrence, and
Methuen&mdash;which are all part of Lori Trahan's 3rd Congressional
District.

## Cities and Towns

There are 32 towns and 7 cities in the 6th District. Of the seven
cities, the largest by far is Lynn with a population of just over
100,000. The mayors of those cities&mdash;worth looking into as
possible congressional seat contendors&mdash;are listed below.

```{r}
gt(ct_6th) |>
    sub_missing(missing_text="") |>
    cols_label(
        city_town = "",
        overlap = "",
        type = "",
        county = "County",
        dist_population = "",
        mayor = "Mayor"
    ) |>
    fmt_number(
        columns=dist_population,
        decimals=0
        ) |>
    gt_plt_bar(
        column=dist_population,
        keep_column=TRUE
    ) |>
    cols_label(DUPE_COLUMN_PLT = "") |>
    tab_spanner(
        label="District Population",
        columns=c(dist_population, DUPE_COLUMN_PLT)
    ) |>
    gt_highlight_rows(
        rows=(type == "City")
    )
```

## State Senate

```{r layout="l-body", fig.height=6, fig.cap="State Senate Districts"}
senate_6th_geom <-
    read_sf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwbensonjr/mapoli/master/gis/geojson/senate2021.geojson") |>
    select(district) |>
    right_join(
        (state_senate_6th |>
         filter(is_eligible) |>
         select(district, legislator, PVI)),
         by="district"
    )

senate_map <-
    (tm_shape(senate_6th_geom) +
     tm_polygons(
         col="MAP_COLORS",
         alpha=0.6
     ) +
     tm_text("district") +
     tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap"))

tmap_leaflet(senate_map)
```

The 3rd Essex, 1st Essex and Middlesex, and 2nd Essex State Senate
districts are completely contained in the 6th Congressional
District. Of the partially contained districts, only the 2nd Essex and
Middlesex has a senator, Barry Finegold, who resides in the
6th. Senator Brendand Crighton (D-Lynn) has indicated that he will not
be seeking the 6th Congressional nomination during this election
cycle, leaving the senators in the highlighted rows as in the mix.

```{r}
state_senate_6th |>
    select(
        district_display,
        legislator,
        PVI,
        dist_population,
        notes,
        is_eligible
    ) |>
    gt() |>
    sub_missing(missing_text="") |>
    cols_hide(columns = is_eligible) |>
    cols_label(
        district_display = "District",
        legislator = "Legislator",
        dist_population = "District Population",
        notes = ""
    ) |>
    fmt_number(
        columns=dist_population,
        decimals=0
    ) |>
    gt_highlight_rows(
        rows=is_eligible
    )
```

## State Representative

```{r layout="l-body", fig.height=6, fig.cap="State Representative Districts"}
rep_6th_geom <-
    read_sf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwbensonjr/mapoli/master/gis/geojson/house2021.geojson") |>
    select(district) |>
    right_join(
        (state_rep_6th |>
         filter(is_eligible) |>
         select(district, legislator, PVI)),
         by="district"
    )

rep_map <-
    (tm_shape(rep_6th_geom) +
     tm_polygons(
         col="MAP_COLORS",
         alpha=0.6
     ) +
     tm_text("district") +
     tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap"))

tmap_leaflet(rep_map)
```

There are 15 State Representative districts fully contained in the 6th
Congressional District, all highlighted in the table below. None of
the representatives in the remaining 7 districts live in the 6th
District. Representative Kenneth Gordon (D-Bedford) lives in the one
Bedford precinct that is part of Katherine Clark's 5th Congressional
District, and Rep. Marc Lombardo (R-Billerica) resides in a Billerica
precinct that is part of Lori Trahan's 3rd District.

```{r}
state_rep_6th |>
    select(
        district_display,
        legislator,
        PVI,
        dist_population,
        notes,
        is_eligible
    ) |>
    gt() |>
    sub_missing(missing_text="") |>
    cols_hide(columns = is_eligible) |>
    cols_label(
        district_display = "District",
        legislator = "Legislator",
        dist_population = "District Population",
        notes = ""
    ) |>
    fmt_number(
        columns=dist_population,
        decimals=0
    ) |>
    gt_highlight_rows(
        rows=is_eligible
    )
```

## Governor's Council

```{r layout="l-body", fig.height=6, fig.cap="Governor's Council Districts"}
gov_council_6th_geom <-
    read_sf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwbensonjr/mapoli/master/gis/geojson/govcouncil2021.geojson") |>
    select(district) |>
    right_join(
        (gov_council_6th |>
         filter(is_eligible) |>
         select(district, legislator, PVI)),
         by="district"
    )

gov_council_map <-
    (tm_shape(gov_council_6th_geom) +
     tm_polygons(
         col="MAP_COLORS",
         alpha=0.6
     ) +
     tm_text("district") +
     tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap"))

tmap_leaflet(gov_council_map)
```

While the 5th Governor's Council District of Eunice Zeigler
(D-Methuen) has the largest overlap with the 6th Congressional
District, Terrence Kennedy (D-Lynnfield) is the only Governor's
Councillor who actually lives in the Congressional district.

```{r}
gov_council_6th |>
    select(
        district_display,
        legislator,
        PVI,
        dist_population,
        notes,
        is_eligible
    ) |>
    gt() |>
    sub_missing(missing_text="") |>
    cols_hide(columns = is_eligible) |>
    cols_label(
        district_display = "District",
        legislator = "Councillor",
        dist_population = "District Population",
        notes = ""
    ) |>
    fmt_number(
        columns=dist_population,
        decimals=0
    ) |>
    gt_highlight_rows(
        rows=is_eligible
    )
```

## Conclusion

This is primarily an exercise in using available district overlap data
to generate a list of people who might be considering a run. Many
people not on this list are thinking about running@mdash;we have
already seen a declaration by former 3rd District congressional
candidate Dan Koh who has declared himself a candidate.

According to the [Secretary of the
Commonwealth](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/elections/getting-on-the-ballot/how-to-run-for-office-2026.htm)
nomination papers will become available in February of 2026, and the
deadlines for submitting papers are May 5 (party candidates to local
officials) and June 2 (for party candidates to file certified
signatures to the Commonwealth).
