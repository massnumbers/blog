    mutate(incumbent = if_else(is_incumbent, "Incumbent", "")) %>%

## State Representative

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}

office_primary_map(
    "State Representative",
    read_sf("https://bwbensonjr.github.io/mapoli/gis/geojson/house2021.geojson"),
    map_districts
)
```

There are a fifteen races where a sitting incumbent State
Representative is being challenged by someone from their own party and
eleven races where the current State Representative is not running and
their is at least one party primary. These are pretty big numbers is
both categories from a historical perspective.

### Incumbent Primaries

There are thirteen Democratic incumbent challenges and two Republican
incumbent challenges&mdash;fifteen in all.

```{r}
office_table_display(
    (primary_view %>% filter(incumbent_primary)),
    "State Representative"
)
```

### Open Seat Primaries

```{r}
office_table_display(
    (primary_view %>% filter(is_open)),
    "State Representative"
)
```

## State Senate

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}

office_primary_map(
    "State Senate",
    read_sf("https://bwbensonjr.github.io/mapoli/gis/geojson/senate2021.geojson"),
    map_districts
)
```

<br/>

Incumbent State Senators Mark Montigny (D-New Bedford), Adam Gomez
(D-Springfield), and Nick Collins (D-Boston) all face primary
challengers. State Representative Bill Driscoll (D-Milton) is running
for the Norfolk, Plymouth and Bristol seat held by retiring Senator
Walter Timilty (D-Milton).

### Incumbent Primaries

```{r}
office_table_display(
    (primary_view %>% filter(incumbent_primary)),
    "State Senate"
)
```

### Open Seat Primaries

```{r}
office_table_display(
    (primary_view %>% filter(is_open)),
    "State Senate"
)
```

### Governor's Council

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}

office_primary_map(
    "Governor's Council",
    read_sf("https://bwbensonjr.github.io/mapoli/gis/geojson/govcouncil2021.geojson"),
    map_districts
)
```

<br/>
There are two incumbent primary challenges and an open seat for the
Governor's Council. Mara Dolan stands a very good chance of unseating
Devaney who has held the seat for 25 years.

```{r}
office_table_display(primary_view, "Governor's Council")
```

### U.S. Congress
 
Unlike the State Representative, State Senate, and Governor's Council
races, the primary race for the Eighth Congressional seat represented
by Stephen Lynch is not an incumbent challenge or for an open seat,
but rather to determine the Republican to face Lynch in the general
election. None of the GOP challengers seem to be taking
this race seriously and only Govatsos has raised any money&mdash;less
than $5,000.

```{r}
office_table_display(primary_view, "Representative in Congress")
```

## U.S. Senate

There are also three Republicans vying for the GOP nomination to face
Senator Elizabeth Warren in the November 5 general election. John
Deaton (R-Swansea) has raised close to a half a million dollars, but
has less-than-stellar chance against Elizabeth Warren if he is the
Republican who makes it to the general.

```{r}
office_table_display(primary_view, "Senator in Congress")
    
```
